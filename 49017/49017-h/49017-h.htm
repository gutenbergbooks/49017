<h2>TRAVELS
IN
KAMTSCHATKA, &amp;c.</h2>

<p>At length the 18 arrived, and I took
leave of M. Kasloff. I shall pass over our
adieux; it will be supposed that they were
equally affectionate and distressing. I departed
from Poustaretsk at eight o’clock in
the morning, in an open sledge drawn by
seven dogs, which I drove myself; the soldier
appointed to escort me had eight harnessed
to his; and we were preceded by a
guide chosen from the inhabitants of this
hamlet<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, whose sledge, loaded with the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of my effects, and our provisions,
was drawn by a team of twelve. I was
accompanied also by M. Schmaleff and the
subaltern officers of his suite; but instead
of travelling together, as had been agreed,
as far as Ingiga, we separated a few days
after.</p>

<p>Upon leaving Poustaretsk, we descended
the gulf. We proceeded at first with tolerable
ease; the ice was solid and even, and
in a few hours we arrived at the mouth:
there our progress was attended with more
difficulty. Obliged to travel upon the sea
without leaving the coast, we were every
moment interrupted with piles of ice, that
appeared like so many rocks, against which
we were to be dashed to pieces. It was
impossible to avoid them by turning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
winding; an unequal chain of these little
mountains extended all along the coast, and
intercepted our passage; we had no resource
but to attempt to surmount them,
at the risk of being overturned every step.
More than once, in these falls, I had a narrow
escape from being dangerously wounded.
My musquet, which was fastened to my
sledge, was bent to the shape of a bow;
many of my companions were severely
bruised, and not an individual came off
unhurt.</p>

<p>In the dusk of the evening we arrived at
a hamlet situated upon the border of the
sea, consisting of two yourts and three balagans,
in a very wretched condition, and
totally deserted. The only person who
lived in the yourt which we entered, had
fled upon our approach<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. I was informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
that this man was a chaman or magician:
seized with terror at the news that we
were to arrive the next day, he flew immediately
for refuge to the Oluterians<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,
where he would probably remain till M.
Kasloff had passed.</p>

<p>The Cossac who gave me this information,
had been sent forward the evening
previous to our departure from Poustaretsk,
by M. Schmaleff, with orders to stop at
this hamlet till we should arrive, and endeavour
in the mean time to discover some
concealed store of fish. This precaution
was very serviceable to us. The Cossac,
upon our arrival, conducted us to a cave
which we found to be well stocked. I took
a tolerable portion, having brought from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Poustaretsk only provision enough for two
days.</p>

<p>The 19, early in the morning we pursued
our route. This day’s journey was
still more fatiguing than the preceding one.
The way was terrible. Twenty times I
saw my sledge ready to be shattered to
pieces, which would certainly have been
the case, if I had not at last determined to
proceed on foot. I was compelled to this,
in order to guard myself against the danger
of being overturned, and thus was I
obliged to walk almost the whole day;
but I only avoided one misfortune to fall
into another.</p>

<p>In a few hours I felt myself so fatigued
that I was going to remount my sledge,
when a sudden jolt instantly turned it upon
its side, and effectually cooled my desire. I
had no resource but to drag myself on as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
well as I could. My legs bent under me,
I was in a profuse perspiration, and a
burning thirst still added to my weariness.
The snow was a poor relief, and I had nothing
else with which to quench my thirst.
Unfortunately I perceived a little river;
absolute necessity conduced my steps to it,
and, without reflecting upon the consequences
of my imprudence, I instantly broke
the ice, and put a piece into my mouth.
This precipitation was purely mechanical,
and I soon repented it. My thirst was relieved;
but from the excessive heat of which
I before complained, I passed to the contrary
extreme; a universal chill seized me,
and all my limbs trembled.</p>

<p>The sharpness of the night increased my
agueish feeling, and my weakness at last
was so extreme, that I was unable to proceed
a step farther. I entreated my companions
to halt in the midst of this desert.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
They complied out of pure civility to me,
for the difficulty of procuring wood was
otherwise a sufficient reason to determine
them to proceed. Scarcely could they collect
enough to place under a kettle; it consisted
of a few little shrubs, so green that it
was almost impossible to make them burn.
How happy were we to succeed so far as to
be able to make tea!</p>

<p>After drinking a few cups, I retired to
my tent<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, where I lay down upon a small
mattrass spread upon the snow, and covered
myself up with a number of furs, in order
to revive perspiration. It was in vain; I did
not close my eyes during the whole night.
To the anguish of a dry and burning fever,
were added a continual oppression, and
all the restlessness peculiar to the first symptoms
of a disorder. I conceived myself, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
acknowledge, to be dangerously ill, particularly
when I found, upon getting up, that
I could not articulate a single sound. I
suffered infinitely both in my breast and
throat; the fever was not abated; nevertheless
the idea that a longer halt in this
place would be of no benefit to me, and
that I could only hope for succour by proceeding,
determined me to conceal my extreme
illness from M. Schmaleff. I was
the first to propose going on, but in this
I consulted my courage more than my
strength.</p>

<p>I had advanced but a few wersts, when
my sufferings became insupportable. I was
obliged to drive myself, and consequently
to be in continual motion; frequently also
I was compelled from the badness of roads,
either to run by the side of my sledge, or
call to the dogs to make them proceed.
My hoarseness prevented their hearing me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and it was only by efforts that exhausted
my strength, and tortured my lungs,
that I at last succeeded. This exercise
however, painful as it was, proved salutary
to me; by degrees it created a perspiration;
in the evening I could breathe
more freely; the fever left me; I had no
complaint but a violent cold, which was
removed in a few days. Fatiguing exercise
was the only remedy I used. I took
particular care to continue the perspiration
it occasioned, and to this I am persuaded
I owe the rapidity of my cure. My breast
however was so sore, that I felt the effects
of it for a considerable time.</p>

<p>During this interval I had nothing to
suffer from the rigour of tempests; the air
was calm, and the weather clear. We were
blessed with the finest days of winter, or I
should perhaps never again have seen my
native country. Heaven seemed to favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
my journey, that I might forget my sufferings.</p>

<p>The most lively joy soon succeeded to the
sorrow that had depressed me. We met, in
different detachments, three convoys sent
by sergeant Kabechoff to M. Kasloff. This
unexpected succour gave me the more pleasure,
as the deplorable state in which I had
left the governor, was continually recurring
to my mind. What a sudden change
in his situation! He was upon the point
of receiving a supply of provisions, together
with an hundred and fifty dogs well fed and
well trained. He will be able, said I to
myself, to proceed immediately on his journey;
and if I cannot flatter myself that I
shall see him again, I know at least that he
will be extricated from his embarassment.
This certainty relieved the anxiety which I
had felt on his account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>The soldier who conducted the convoys,
offered me part of his provisions; but I refused
them. He had no profusion, and we
were not in want. I detained him therefore
as short a time as possible.</p>

<p>Before he quitted us, he told me that
prince Eitel, or chief of the Koriacs of
Kaminoi, who had been accused of rebellion,
was advancing to undeceive the governor,
and prove the falsehood of the
charge.</p>

<p>In pursuing our route, we perceived, beyond
a small river bordered with some
shrubs, a chain of steep mountains, which it
was necessary to climb one after the other,
in order to descend upon another river,
called Talofka. Its banks diverged as it
approached the sea; they were well wooded,
and I perceived some trees of a tolerable
size. We left this river at a distance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Kaminoi, in order to traverse an extensive
heath, then a considerable lake; at length
we crossed the river Pengina, almost at its
mouth, and in a direction from south-east
to north-west. Its breadth is striking, and
the aspect of the heaps of ice that covered
it, and which were of an extreme height,
would have been still more picturesque, if
we could have taken a more convenient
way; but we had no choice, and were reduced
to the necessity of hoisting, as I may
say, our dogs and our sledges from heap to
heap. The difficulty and slowness of this
manœuvre is easily conceived; it required
my utmost exertion and care to get off unhurt.</p>

<p>It was still near two hours before we
reached Kaminoi, where we arrived the 24
before noon. We were received by the inhabitants
with the utmost civility. In the
absence of Eitel, another prince called <i>Eila</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
had the command. He came to meet us
with a Russian detachment, and we were
conducted to the yourt of Eitel, which had
been cleaned and prepared a long time for
the reception of M. Kasloff.</p>

<p>Eila conferred upon us every mark of
respect; we had constantly a centinel at our
door, whose orders were to open it to such
persons only as we had no reason to distrust.</p>

<p>This was not owing to any doubts we entertained
respecting the report that had
been spread of the rebellion of the Koriacs;
it was evidently false<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Their behaviour to
us, and the reception they had prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
for the governor, plainly proved what was
their disposition at present. Nor is it to be
presumed that this was the effect of the
arrival of the soldiers sent from Ingiga<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.
Their wretched condition was little calculated
to awe men like the Koriacs, who are
too little attached to life, I understand, to
be ever intimidated; and whom nothing
can restrain, if they have the least ground
for discontent.</p>

<p>The sight however of the cannon, and of
the Cossacs in arms, who had entered the
village without announcing any hostile intention,
gave them at first some alarm.
Immediately advancing towards the subaltern
officer who commanded the troop, they
called upon him to declare, whether he was
come to strike a blow at their liberty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
extirpate them; adding, that if such were
the project of the Russians, the Koriacs
would all die to a man, rather than submit.
The officer removed their fears, by artfully
answering, that the occasion of his embassy
ought not to alarm them; that he was sent
to meet M. Kasloff, which was an honour
due to his rank, and prescribed by the military
regulations of Russia towards their
governors. This explanation was sufficient
to remove their suspicions; and the Koriacs
and Russians lived together upon terms of
the best understanding. The confidence of
the Koriacs was so great, that they took no
precautions against a surprise, and would
have paid no attention to the continued
abode of these soldiers among them, but for
a famine, which began to render such guests
burthensome.</p>

<p>I had intended to stay no longer at Kaminoi
than was necessary to rest my dogs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
but on the night of the 24, the sky became
obscured, and frequent gusts of wind
threatened an approaching tempest; the
fear of encountering it in the open field,
made me defer my departure.</p>

<p>This ostrog is three hundred wersts from
Poustaretsk, and is situated upon an eminence
near the sea coast, and at the mouth
of the river Pengina. It contains a great
number of balagans and twelve yourts, all
of them very large, and built in a similar
manner to those I have already described.
Though very near to one another, these
habitations occupy a considerable space of
ground. The palisades which surround
them are fortified with spears, bows and
arrows, and musquets. They are thicker
and higher than those placed round the
Kamtschadale yourts. Within these wretched
fortifications the Koriacs consider themselves
as impregnable. Here they repel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
attacks of their enemies, and among others,
the Tchoukchis, who are the most formidable
of their neighbours, both in point of
number and courage<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>The population at Kaminoi scarcely exceeds
three hundred persons, including
men, women, and children. I shall say nothing
of the manners of the inhabitants
till my arrival at Ingiga, which will I hope
be in a few days.</p>

<p>Before I left the village, I saw a dozen
baidars, or boats, of different sizes, similar
to the one I mentioned upon coming out of
Khaluli<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, except that they were better constructed,
and from their superior lightness,
had the advantage in sailing. I admired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
also their remarkable breadth. Many of
these baidars would hold from twenty-five
to thirty persons.</p>

<p>From the moment of our arrival, M.
Schmaleff had foreseen that he should not
be able to accompany me from this village.
Beset evening and morning by the whole
detachment of soldiers, who came to acquaint
him with the urgency of their wants, he
considered it as his duty not to abandon
them, but to employ all the means which
his office and his perfect knowledge of the
country afforded him for procuring them
assistance. He was equally impatient with
myself to get to Ingiga, where his brother
had long expected him: but he resolved
nevertheless to let me depart without him.</p>

<p>He informed me of this circumstance
with regret, and gave me at the same time
a confidential soldier, named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<i>Yegor-Golikoff</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. He made me, he said, in this man
a valuable present; and we shall find in the
sequel that he was not deceived.</p>

<p>This kindness increased the reluctance I
felt at being obliged so soon to leave this
good and gallant officer. My gratitude
would lead me to repeat in this place, what
the English have written of his humanity
and politeness; but I leave to count de la
Perouse the pleasure of acquitting the debt
which every individual in the expedition
owes to M. Schmaleff, for his assiduity in
rendering it, while at Saint Peter and Saint
Paul’s, all the services that were in his
power.</p>

<p>I came out of Kaminoi at eight o’clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in the morning of the 26, the weather
being tolerably calm<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. At the distance of
fifteen wersts, I again met with the chain of
mountains which I had before passed on this
side of the village. I traversed them a second
time, and then crossed a river called
<i>Chestokova</i>, from a subaltern officer of that
name, who had been killed there at the
head of a detachment sent to keep the revolted
Koriacs in awe. Under advantage of
the night the Koriacs had taken them by
surprise upon the border of this river, and
had not suffered an individual to escape:
all the Russians were massacred. I halted
in the same place.</p>

<p>I was roused from my sleep by the gusts
of wind that blew with extreme violence.
The clouds of snow obscured the air to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
a degree, that it was not easy to distinguish
if it were day. In spite of this dreadful
hurricane I resolved to proceed; but I
could not prevail on my guides to make
even the attempt. They persisted in not
quitting the place, from the apprehension of
losing their way, and encountering other
dangers in such bad weather.</p>

<p>Opposed on all sides, I retired to my tent
in no very pleasant humour. At noon I
was agreeably consoled by the arrival of
seven Tchoukchis. They were in sledges,
similar to those of the wandering Koriacs,
and drawn in like manner by rein deer. I
received them under my tent, and invited
them to remain till the storm was dissipated.
Nothing could have flattered them more,
as I judged from the air of satisfaction
which my offer imparted to the countenance
of every individual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Among these Tchoukchis was the chief
of the horde, called <i>Tummé</i>. He addressed
himself to me in order to express the gratitude
they felt for the reception I gave them.
He assured me that ever since they had
heard of me, they had desired nothing so
ardently as my acquaintance, and had been
greatly alarmed lest they should lose the
opportunity. He added, that they would
never forget either my person or my kindnesses,
and that they would give an exact account
of every thing to their countrymen.
I answered with a profusion of thanks, informing
them that I had been already made
acquainted with their obliging curiosity, and
that I had not been less desirous of the present
interview.</p>

<p>After this preface, we talked upon general
subjects, particularly upon their country
and mine. My curiosity was equal to
theirs, and the time passed in perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
questions. As I told them that, in returning
to France, I must pass through the
town that was the residence of their sovereign,
they begged me to give her a faithful
account of them, and to lay at her feet
the tribute of their respect and submission.
They added, that they were by so much the
more happy in being tributaries of Russia,
as they every day found the Russians more
easy of access, and more affectionate in their
behaviour. They spoke with particular
commendation of M. Gaguen, governor of
Ingiga.</p>

<p>The kindness they had experienced, made
them regret the want of opportunity to
maintain a more frequent intercourse with
the Russians. The only mode, they said, of
surmounting these difficulties, would be for
the subjects of the Czarina to form afresh
their establishment upon the river Anadir.
They promised for the future that, far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
giving any interruption to the settlers, they
would exert themselves by every office of
friendship to make them forget the injustice
of their past conduct. That conduct
had originated in an error, under which
they laboured as well as the Koriacs, in having
formerly figured to themselves the Russians
as consisting only of that small number
of individuals, who came in this adventurous
manner to plant themselves in
their territory and neighbourhood. By a
natural sentiment of jealousy, they had regarded
these emigrants as so many adversaries,
whose industry and activity were the
objects of their suspicion; and they conceived
that nothing could be of more importance
to them than to rid themselves of
the intruders, persuaded that in exterminating
the settlers they should destroy the
race.</p>

<p>The Tchoukchis professed to have discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
their mistake, and their folly as soon
as they had been properly acquainted with
the Russians. It was in vain that they were
now persuaded to revolt, they being on the
contrary disposed to counteract the seditious
intrigues of a prince, or chief of the Tchoukchis,
whose residence was fixed, by name
<i>Kherourgui</i>, either by curtailing his authority,
or even by delivering him up to the
Russians.</p>

<p>Not being able to conceive in what part
of the world I was born, they asked me if
my country were not on the other side of
the great river. Before I answered them,
I desired to know the meaning of their
question; and I found they imagined that
beyond Russia, with which country itself
they had little acquaintance, there was a
very large river that divided them from
another country inhabited by different
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not easy to instruct them upon
this subject. I talked a long while without
their understanding a single word of my
geographical dissertation. They had no
accurate idea either of number or extension.
It was not less difficult to give them a notion
of the strength of a state, or the riches
and power of its sovereign. They had
never attempted an estimation even of that
of Russia. That I might enable them to
judge of it, I was obliged to illustrate the
abundance of its commodities, its money,
and its population, by comparisons drawn
from the number of animals they hunted,
and the quantity of fish they caught every
year, without destroying the breed. This
explanation, which I exerted all my ability
to make level to their capacities, extremely
pleased them. I adopted the same method
to give them a notion of the way measure
extension. I began with the ground
that my tent covered, and the taking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
sheet of paper, drew a sort of geographical
chart, in which I marked pretty nearly the
situation and distances of Russia and France,
with respect to their country.</p>

<p>It was not without some labour that I
made myself understood. But for this I
was indemnified by the eagerness and attention
with which they listened to me. In
general I was astonished at the solidity of
their understanding, and the thirst they felt
for the acquisition of knowledge. Superior
in these respects to the Koriacs, they
appear both to respect more upon what they
say themselves, and what they hear and
behold. These two people have nearly the
same idiom; the only difference is, that I
found in the Tchoukchis a habit of prolonging
the final syllables of words, and a
pronunciation slower and sweeter than that
of the Koriacs. With the assistance of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
guide, who served me for an interpreter, I
kept up the conversation tolerably well.</p>

<p>The attention with which I examined
their dress, inspired them with a desire of
seeing the French habit<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, and I ordered
my uniform to be taken out of my portmanteau.
At sight of it they expressed admiration
in every part of their attitude.
Every one was eager to touch it, every one
exclaimed upon its singularity and its beauty.
My buttons, marked with the arms of
France, were particularly inspected, and it
was necessary anew to exert my ingenuity
to describe to them intelligibly, what this
figure represented, and what was its use.
But they did not allow me to finish. They
eagerly reached out their hands, and intreated
me to divide them among them. I
consented, upon the promise they gave me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to preserve them with extreme care. Their
object in keeping them, was to employ them
as a mark of affection, which they might
shew to all the strangers that touched upon
their coast, in hopes that among the rest
there might possibly arrive a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Their countrymen had seen the English
some years before. “Why, said they, do
not the French also visit us? They might
depend upon being received by us with
cheerfulness and cordiality.” I thanked
them for their obliging disposition, and represented
to them that the distance was an
insuperable obstacle, and would not permit
us to put their kindness often to the proof.
Meanwhile I promised to give a faithful
representation of it upon my arrival in
France.</p>

<p>After regaling them in the best manner
I could with tobacco, having nothing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
could afford them greater pleasure, we parted
upon the best terms of friendship. Upon
leaving me, they said, that I should probably
soon met their equipages and their
wives, whom they had left behind in order
to make the greater haste.</p>

<p>The wind became calm shortly after the
departure of these Tchoukchis, and I pursued
my journey.</p>

<p>The next day, at the very moment when
I was about to stop, upon seeing a convenient
place by the side of a wood, I perceived
farther on before me a numerous troop of
rein deer browsing at liberty upon the top
of a mountain. Upon examining them
more attentively, I distinguished some men
who appeared to be guarding them. I
hesitated at first whether I should avoid, or
join them; but curiosity at length prevailed,
and I advanced to reconnoitre them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>By proceeding along the skirts of the
wood I was told I should come up with
them. I conceived however that at the
extremity I should be still separated from
them by a river, a small arm of which I had
crossed a quarter of an hour before: at this
place it was tolerably wide. While I was
examining these people from one bank to
the other, I was approached by two women
who were walking about. The eldest accosted
me. How great was my surprise to
hear both her and her companion speak
the Russian language! They informed me
that I was but two hundred yards from the
camp of the Tchoukchis, the view of which
was intercepted by the wood. As soon
indeed as I got down to the side of the river
I could see their sledges and their tents, and
I entreated these women to conduct me
thither.</p>

<p>As we went on, I asked them of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
country they were, their language telling
me that they were neither born, nor had
always lived among these people.</p>

<p>One of them informed me that she was
a Russian, and had been induced to accompany
the Tchoukchis from a sentiment of
maternal affection. Dangers, fatigues, ill
treatment, she had braved every thing, from
the sole motive of reclaiming her daughter,
who was retained by them as an hostage.
She had lost her in the following manner.</p>

<p>This young woman was travelling, two
years before, with her father and a number
of other Russians upon the river Pengina.
Their caravan, consisting of nine persons,
was proceeding quietly along in the midst
of the Koriacs, threatened at that time by
a party of Tchoukchis, headed by this very
Kherourgui whom we just now mentioned.
To get rid of their dangerous neighbours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the Koriacs conceived the design of informing
the Tchoukchis of the passage of these
strangers<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, as a prize that ought not to escape
them. The artifice succeeded. Seduced
by the expectation of an immense
booty in iron and tobacco, the Tchoukchis
followed these travellers. Their courage
could not save them, and four of them, with
their arms in their hands, became the victims
of a fruitless resistance. The husband
of this woman was killed in defending his
daughter, whom the conquerors carried off
with the three remaining companions of her
misfortune. The Russians had incessantly
demanded the surrender of these prisoners,
and the Tchoukchis had promised to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
them back; but only two of them had yet
been released.</p>

<p>The affecting recital of this unfortunate
mother, which was frequently interrupted
by her tears, interested me strongly in her
favour. Without knowing whether the
mediation would have any weight with the
Tchoukchis, I felt myself disposed to join
my intreaties to hers, and I had the satisfaction
to perceive that they were not nugatory.</p>

<p>The other woman told me that she was
by birth a Tchoukchi. In her infancy
she had been taken by the Russians upon
the river Anadir, and carried to Yakoutsk,
where they had given her the best education
in their power. She afterwards married a
soldier, by whom she was in a few years left
a widow. At length, by order of government,
she was sent back to her own country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
with her children, to render an account of
the obligations that she owed to the Russians.
It had been recommended to her to
give the minutest details to the Tchoukchis,
even such as lived to the greatest distance<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>,
and insinuate to them the innumerable advantages
they might derive from establishing
a safe and peaceable commerce with the
Russians.</p>

<p>This woman spoke the Russian, the Yakout,
and the Tchoukchi languages with
equal facility. She told me, that the little
knowledge she derived from her education,
had gained her a sort of credit with her
compatriots; that she had already taken
advantage of her ascendancy over their
minds, to destroy several of their prejudices;
and she flattered herself that by degrees
they would be taught to see their interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
in its true light. Her hopes were
chiefly founded upon the character of this
people, which she assured me was perfectly
generous, hospitable, mild, and preferable
in every respect to that of the Koriacs.</p>

<p>The conversation of these women had so
engrossed my attention, that I was in the
camp of the Tchoukchis before I perceived
it. Their joy at seeing me was extreme,
and I was surrounded in an instant. They
all addressed themselves to me at once, to
prevail on me to spend the night with them.
I had no sooner answered that it was my intention,
than they saluted me with new
transports and huzzas. I ordered my tent
to be erected at the extremity of the camp,
and while it was performing I invited the
chiefs to visit me. Eager to accept my invitation,
they could not wait till I had entered
my tent, and I found a more numerous
assembly than it could contain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>After the first compliments were over,
we entered into conversation, mutually desirous
of receiving information. We talked
in a summary way of our respective countries,
manners, and customs; and the questions
they asked me were nearly similar
to those of Tummé and his companions.
They expressed their submission to Russia,
their desire of forming an alliance with that
country by means of a commercial intercourse,
and of seeing the establishment upon
the Anadir revived. They then entered
into particulars upon the motives of their
journey. Their principal inducement was
to visit some relations who had intermarried
with the Russians, and settled at Ingiga.
They had also, it was probable, some commercial
project in view, though from their
own account, attachment to their countrymen
was their only motive; and in reality,
this patriotic sentiment was visible I thought
in their attention to this Tchoukchi woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and the caresses they bestowed upon her
children.</p>

<p>They frequently entreated me to banish
all distrust from my mind, and to rely upon
their friendship. They seemed to suppose
that I partook of the reserve which the Russians
discovered in their intercourse with
them; but not having the same reasons to
fear them, I was a stranger to suspicion. I
wished them to understand this by my answer,
which was, that being unwilling to
offend any individual I might meet with in
my way, I imagined that no one would be
desirous of incommoding me, particularly
in the midst of a nation whose civility and
rectitude were already known to me. This
mode of reasoning pleased them, and they
appeared to be flattered by my security. I
conceived of course that I ought to conceal
my arms, and reject the proposal made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
my soldiers of placing a centinel before my
tent.</p>

<p>I distributed tobacco to the most distinguished
of these Tchoukchis, and afterwards
treated them with tea and rye biscuit.
Their chief, or prince, named <i>Chegouiaga</i>,
of the same rank and authority as
Tummé, two of his relations, and the two
women who served as interpreters, supped
with me. The repast was perfectly frugal
but very gay, and my guests were as well
pleased as if they had fared ever so sumptuously.
The necessity of taking rest obliged
us to separate.</p>

<p>As soon as I was alone, I embraced the
opportunity of writing down the notes with
which their conversation and my own observations
had furnished me.</p>

<p>The camp of these Tchoukchis was pitched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
upon the border of the river, by the side
of their equipages, and at the back of the
wood which I mentioned. It contained
about a dozen tents ranged in a line along
the bank. They were of a square form,
and made of rein deer skin, suspended by
leathern straps to four poles erected at the
four corners. Bundles of spears and arrows,
fixed in the snow before every tent, seem to
guard the entrance<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, which is very low, and
shuts <i>hermetically</i>. The tents are extremely
hot. The partitions and the covering being
made of deer skin, the air cannot penetrate,
and there is besides a stove in the middle of
each of them. The bed resembles that of
the Kamtschadales when they halt, and consists
of small branches of trees spread on the
snow like litter, and covered with deer skins.
Here a whole family will lie down and sleep
together without distinction of age or sex.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
The space is so narrow that it is astonishing
how so many people can crowd into it. The
air and filthiness occasioned by it are insupportable;
let it suffice to say, that they feel
no disgust at seeing their food and their
drink close to the most offensive objects, for
no words can describe the excess of their
indolence.</p>

<p>Among these Tchoukchis, whose number
amounted to about forty, there were
fifteen or sixteen women<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, and nearly as
many children, who are employed in preparing
the tents and provisions. Every
principal person has valets in his service to
take care of the deer, and guard them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
during the night from the wolves with
which these coasts abound.</p>

<p>The dress of the women is very remarkable.
It consists of a single deer skin that
is fastened round the neck, where it has an
opening both before and behind, and which
descends in the shape of large breeches below
the knee. This garment is put on
by means of the opening at the neck, and
there is no other way of taking it off but by
loosening the strings which tie it under the
chin, when it instantly falls from the body,
and leaves the woman naked. The inconvenience
of this habit may easily be imagined,
from the frequent necessity there must
be of divesting themselves of it. When they
travel, they wear a <i>kouklanki</i> over their common
dress, and their feet have no other covering
than boots made of the legs of rein
deer. Their hair is of a deep black. Sometimes
it is turned up in tufts behind, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
is oftener separated upon the forehead, and
hangs in long braids on each side. Their
ears and their neck are loaded with ornaments
of glass beads of different colours;
and when they are cold, the hood of their
parque serves them for a head-dress.</p>

<p>Their countenance is by no means agreeable;
the features are coarse, though their
nose is not flat, nor their eyes sunk in their
head like the Kamtschadales. They resemble
them in these respects less than do the
Koriac women. They are also taller, but
not slender. The thickness and bulk of
their dress give them an appearance the
very opposite to alert. In the mean time
they perform the most laborious offices, such
as lighting fire, cutting wood, fetching
water, and other things required in their
domestic œconomy. These cares devolve
principally upon the oldest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>The features of the men seemed to be
more regular, and not at all Asiatic. Their
complexion, like that of the women, is very
tawny; and their dress, their sledges, and
in short, all their customs are exactly similar
to those of the wandering Koriacs. I shall
take an opportunity of describing them
together.</p>

<p>These Tchoukchis at present go every
year to Ingiga. They leave their country
in the beginning of autumn, and do not
arrive at this settlement till March. As soon
as their business is transacted, which only
requires a few days, they set out upon their
return, that they may not lose the advantage
of travelling in sledges; but they seldom
reach their home till the latter end of
June.</p>

<p>The merchandise they take with them
consists chiefly of sable and fox-skin parques,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and moose teeth, which afford a very
fine ivory. They receive in exchange kettles,
tobacco, lances, musquets, knives, and
other iron instruments. As yet they are
little accustomed to the musquet, and
scarcely make any use of it; but they are
very expert in shooting an arrow, and managing
a lance, which are therefore their
principal arms.</p>

<p>Like all the northern people, they have
an astonishing propensity to drunkenness.
Their love of brandy is so extreme, that if
you once let them taste it, you must repeat
your kindness till they are perfectly intoxicated,
or they would consider themselves
as insulted, and probably have recourse to
menaces and violence, to obtain their ends.
As incessant smokers as the Koriacs, they
have the same pipes and the same method
of using them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Being unwilling to prolong my stay, I
went as soon as it was light to take leave of
these Tchoukchis in their tents, but the
unwholesome air and the heat soon obliged
me to withdraw. Our parting was very
affectionate; each in his turn overwhelmed
me with embraces. It may be supposed I
did not fall short in my compliments, nor
could I in reality too highly extol the reception
of this hospitable people.</p>

<p>I set off early enough to travel this day
thirty wersts. About half way I found
upon the sea coast two balagans and a yourt,
inhabited by a Koriac family, and an hour
after I reached the ostrog of Pareiné.</p>

<p>This village is less than Kaminoi, but
more populous and well situated. It is
upon a river, from which it takes its name,
and about three wersts from where it pours
its waters into the sea of Pengina, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
forms at this place so narrow a gulf, that in
clear weather one can see from one shore to
the other.</p>

<p>The first person I saw in the village was
an old woman of a mixed breed, whose
melancholy appearance struck me. Either
from compassion or curiosity, I instantly approached
her. Upon my questioning her
respecting the cause of her distress, she uttered
a loud shriek, and answered me only
by her tears. My intreaties, and the sympathy
I discovered, at last drew from her
the recital of her misfortune.</p>

<p>About a fortnight before, she had left
Ingiga with her husband, her son, and a
number of friends, to visit some relations at
Pareiné. Overtaken in their way by one of
those terrible hurricanes, whose fatal effects
I have been twenty times upon the verge of
experiencing, these travellers had strayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
from the road, and been separated from
one another. The father and son were in
the same sledge. Having wandered a long
time in pursuit of a shelter, or to discover
some vestiges of the road, they were at
length totally lost. After two days search,
they were found buried in the snow, and
dead with cold. Their bodies were completely
frozen, and their posture indicated,
that these two unfortunate beings, no longer
able to drag themselves on, had lain down
close together to keep themselves warm, and
died in each others arms. More successful
than her husband, this woman had found a
shelter by the side of a river, fifteen wersts
from Pareiné, where she had arrived with
her companions, exhausted with fatigue,
and half dead with grief. She added, that
during this tempest it was impossible to see
either the heavens or the earth. The snow,
frozen in the air, grew thicker as it fell,
and was like a shower of icicles. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
clothes had been so pierced by it as to be
perfectly useless. But what still increased
this woman’s affliction, was the inability in
which she found herself of returning to her
country. No person seemed disposed to
supply her with the means, which she continually
solicited, but without effect. Upon
this she burst into a flood of tears. I said
every thing that compassion suggested to
me to console her; and quitted her with
regret, at not being able to afford her any
relief, and showing her only a fruitless
pity.</p>

<p>While I was conversing with her, the
inhabitants of Pareiné crowded about me.
Their chief or prince, called <i>Youltitka</i>, approached
to invite me to pass the night in
the village. His sinister countenance confirmed
every thing that had been said of
his perfidy, and I gave him to understand,
that I had no desire to stop. Upon my refusal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
he mentioned the impossibility of procuring
me dogs and provisions till the next
morning. The reasons he assigned plainly
discovered his ill will<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, and betrayed, I
thought, some fatal intention. Resolved to
escape, whatever it might cost me, I replied,
that I could very well do without what I
was unable to obtain, but that no consideration
should induce me to stay. He feigned
not to comprehend me, and alledged some
new obstacle, regarding me at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
time with a bitter smile, that seemed to defy
me to proceed. I felt that I must arm myself
with the utmost firmness, or patiently submit
to whatever law it might please this
wretch to impose upon me. The whole village
was present. Two hundred men at least
pressed tumultuously about me, either to inspire
me with terror, or to observe my embarassment.
In this perilous conjuncture, I
conceived the design of addressing myself to
them in the Russian language, hoping that
there might be some among them who
would understand me, and who might be
less unmanageable than their chief.</p>

<p>My harangue was short, but vehement.
I enforced the consideration of my character
as a stranger, my claims upon their assistance,
my desire of meriting it by my behaviour
towards them, and the kindness I
had received from their countrymen in the
course of my journey. I added, that except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
in the present instance, I had never had
occasion to demand the succours of which I
stood in need; far from waiting till I produced
my orders, they had showed the utmost
readiness to anticipate my wishes, before
I could make them known.</p>

<p>At the mention of the word order, I perceived
that they looked with a kind of
astonishment upon one another. In proportion
as my address made an impression
upon them, I assumed more warmth and
assurance. Then drawing on a sudden my
passport from my pocket, and fixing my
eyes with an air of displeasure upon Youltitka,
I presented it to him, declaring at the
same time that I meaned to depart in two
hours at latest. This abrupt conclusion disconcerted
him. He perceived that he could
not avoid complying with my wishes, without
rendering himself criminal; and the
mandate of the governor was too formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and too authoritative for him to dare to oppose
it. He therefore ordered that the
quantity of fish which I wanted, should immediately
be collected, intreating me at the
same time to have some regard to the smallness
of their stock, which I should very considerably
diminish. It was this idea, he
said, that had induced him to make any
difficulties, as he was afraid that I should
totally exhaust their caves. This was a
mere subterfuge, as I was soon convinced
that they were abundantly stored.</p>

<p>In the mean time, that he might be
thought desirous of making some amends
for his uncivil reception, or perhaps with a
view of making me repent the having forced
him in his last intrenchments, he invited me
to wait in his yourt, till my people had
made the necessary preparations for my departure.
To refuse would have shown a
degree of inquietude; I wished, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
fully to convince him of my intrepidity.
It was besides the hour for dining,
and with the hope of imperceptibly gaining
the traitor, I accepted his invitation, offering
to treat him with a better repast than it was
in his power to provide for me. I followed
him with a countenance as tranquil as if I
had felt myself in perfect security. To
speak the truth, however, I was not without
trouble, when, upon coming to his yourt, I
found it necessary to descend forty feet
under ground. The extraordinary depth
of this retreat delivered me entirely to the
mercy of my host. My companions could
neither have heard nor assisted me. I shuddered
at my own imprudence, but it was
too late to draw back. I was well armed,
and I prepared to defend myself as well as
I could in case of an insult.</p>

<p>The first care of Youltitka was to seat me
in the place of honour, that is, in a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
alcove reserved for the chief of the family.
His was a very numerous one, nearly eighty
persons living with him in this yourt. They
had all deserted it upon the report of my
arrival, and were still about my people, so
that I was alone to contend with three or
four companions or relations of Youltitka,
who surrounded me, thrusting their noses
almost in my face. Supposing themselves
to be adepts in the Russian language, because
they were able to murder a few words,
they asked me, in turn, a variety of questions,
each more absurd than the preceding.
My situation dictated politeness, and I answered
them with mildness and precision.
I thus passed an hour in the midst of these
savage figures, truly calculated to inspire
dread, particularly that of their chief<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
My soldier did not make his appearance,
and I began to be uneasy. Upon a motion
which I made to come out, these Koriacs
placed themselves before me. One of them
caught hold of my arm to make me sit
down, asking me if I wanted to escape. I
endeavoured to look as stoutly as I could,
but I confess my heart palpitated. I again
took my seat; and in spite of the alteration
which they might perceive in my face, I
replied, that I did not imagine I had any
reason to fear them. Youltitka then endeavoured
to excite my confidence. He
swore that he had the highest esteem for
me, and that I was in perfect safety. His
past conduct, he added, might have given
me reason to suspect his character, but he
considered it as a point of honour to set
me right. Proud of having been received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
among the judges of the tribunal of Ingiga<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>,
he valued his reputation too much
to suffer any one to treat me ill in his presence.</p>

<p>I knew my man too well to place any
faith in these asseverations, and I considered
myself as happy that he dared not do what
was in his power, and probably what was
in his heart. I hastened therefore to quit
the yourt, upon the pretext of seeking for
my people, and giving them orders for
dinner. I could not however rid myself of
this treacherous Koriac. He persisted in
accompanying me. Every word I uttered
seemed to alarm him. Not understanding
the Russian language, he immediately asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the meaning of what I said, and watched
all my motions with singular attention.</p>

<p>I found my people occupied in bartering
the bad dogs they had left, for furs, and
articles of dress made of rein deer-skin.
Their avarice had made them forgetful of
what I had recommended to them, and the
danger in which they had left me; but I
concealed my displeasure on account of my
witnesses. I again descended the yourt, accompanied
by Youltitka and my two soldiers,
who began immediately to prepare
our dinner. The women assisted them in
cleaning the dishes<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>; and with the help
of brandy, good humour gradually succeeded
to fears and distrust. Our repast was
very jovial, and I frequently endeavoured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
imitate my guests in their loud peals of
laughter, outrageous expression of sentiment
being the only thing that pleases
them. The dinner being finished, I sent
one of my soldiers to order the dogs to
be harnessed, a part of which was a fresh
supply. My provisions were also ready,
and in ten minutes I was prepared to take
leave of my Koriacs. They appeared to
be satisfied with me; I know not whether
they were really so, but I acknowledge
as to myself that I was glad to escape
from them, and I set off therefore as quick
as possible.</p>

<p>It was only two o’clock in the afternoon;
but I conceived that I ought to make up
for the forced delay I had experienced, and
did not therefore halt till I was fifteen wersts
from Pareiné.</p>

<p>This day and the next, which was the 30,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
afforded nothing that was worth reciting.
I crossed a variety of rivers, not one of
which was considerable, but there were a
few shrubs on the banks of some of them.
Upon leaving Pareiné I had quitted the sea,
and should see no more of it on this side of
Ingiga, of consequence we had no chance
of procuring dry wood, which we sometimes
found while we travelled upon the
coast. This was a considerable loss to us,
from the necessity to which it reduced us
of gathering every little shrub we could
perceive, and the fear that even this paltry
resource might fail us.</p>

<p>For a long time my principal food had
been rein deer. Delicious as this meat is,
there is I believe none of which one is so
soon tired. The worst circumstance however
was, that our stock began to be exhausted.
We only eat of it once a day;
our other meals consisted of dried fish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the flesh of the sea wolf boiled. I was
highly gratified this day by a brace of partridges,
which I had the good fortune to
kill, and which were added to my table.
This gave an agreeable relief to the tedious
uniformity of my daily food.</p>

<p>The day was beautiful, and a clear sky
seemed to promise us colder weather, which
was what we wished, the snow being so
soft that our dogs sunk to their bellies. To
open a way for them, each of us was obliged
to run before with our rackets. The hope
that the next day would afford us better
travelling, animated my guides, and we
made tolerable speed. It was late when
we stopped at a place that was not at all
sheltered; there was no wood except a
sort of dwarf cedar, resinous, crooked, and
grovelling.</p>

<p>Before I retired to my tent, I perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
at the horizon some ill-boding clouds. I
had been sufficiently habituated to the climate
to be able to judge of the weather
from the most trivial appearances, and I
communicated my conjectures to my guides.
They considered their knowledge in this
respect as infinitely superior to mine, and
replied, that the setting sun had been too
beautiful to give us any reason to apprehend
foul weather. According to their own
account they were never deceived, and I
might implicitly rely upon their judgment.
Upon reflection I was not sorry to find
them in this security, as it relieved me from
the fear of being constrained by them to
pass the day in this place, which would not
be tenable against the first gust of wind.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light I was waked by
one of my guides, who, in a tone of raillery,
came to hasten my departure, that we might
not lose the advantage of the fine day we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
were likely to have. The moon still shone,
and the sky was without a cloud. While I
was at breakfast, as usual, upon tea and
rye biscuit, which my people had reserved
for me, willing rather to want it themselves
than that I should be without it, they questioned
me one after another respecting the
weather. It was a contest who should banter
me most. I persevered however in my
opinion, desiring them to wait till the evening
before they judged whether I was right
or wrong in prognosticating a storm.</p>

<p>We had scarcely broke up our camp, when
we perceived at some distance a company
consisting of five Koriac sledges, drawn by
rein deer. Our dogs, allured by the scent
of these animals, advanced towards them
with astonishing ardour. The nearer we
approached, the more these Koriacs seemed
to avoid us. I imagined at first that it was
the natural effect of their distrust, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
cry and eagerness of our dogs, soon told me
what was the source of their terror. They
would infallibly have rushed upon them if
they had been more at liberty. I ordered
my guides therefore to halt. The difficulty
was to restrain our steeds, which we did not
effect without considerable exertion. We
then endeavoured by signs to make the
Koriacs understand that we were desirous
of a moment’s conversation with them.
They appeared to hold a consultation, and
after a few minutes one of their company
was dispatched to us. He stopped about
three hundred yards from us, and desired
us in like manner by signs to send also one
of our body, and particularly to keep back
our dogs. I ordered one of my soldiers to
go with his rackets to meet this Koriac, and
to ask him whence they came, whither they
were bound, if they knew any thing relative
to M. Kasloff, and what distance they imagined
us to be from Ingiga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of half an hour my messenger
came back with the following information.
These people were wandering Koriacs,
returning to their families from Ingiga,
where they had been to see their
friends and sell their deer skins. They had
heard they thought of a supply of dogs
and provisions being sent a short time since
to the governor-general, but they could give
us no certain intelligence. Their account
of our distance from Ingiga corresponded
with the opinion of my guide, whom I had
just before interrogated upon the subject, in
consequence of a new debate between my
people and me. It originated thus.</p>

<p>While we waited the return of the soldier,
I observed some clouds pass rapidly
over our heads, the form and direction of
which confirmed me in the idea that we
were threatened by an approaching tempest.
My confidential soldier, Golikoff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
had been equally incredulous with the rest,
and readily defended the contrary opinion;
in the mean time he agreed that at present
there was every appearance that my predictions
would be verified; he had even
mentioned me, he said, to the Koriacs, as a
prophet in this respect, and he should be
sorry to see me mistaken in the very first instance,
and lose my credit.</p>

<p>This simple avowal was the more diverting
to me, as my conductors were witnesses
to it. It suggested to me the desire of amusing
myself in my turn with their ignorant
simplicity. The opportunity was favourable.
I repeated, that in two hours
at latest, they would be convinced of my
knowledge, but that it was first necessary I
should be informed whether we should
meet with any place of shelter in our way.
One of them answered me in the negative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
“Till we came to the river Ingiga, we had
to traverse an immense and naked plain,
where the eye could merely discern a few
inequalities, occasioned by the soil, or the
snow drifted by the hurricanes, and congealed
by the frost.” This intelligence
embarassed me, apprehensive that we should
be compelled to return for shelter to a little
wood which we had just passed. We were
scarcely half a league from it, but the obstinacy
of my guides in support of the
opinion that we had nothing to fear, removed
the difficulty. Imboldened by
their supposed experience, they were desirous
that we should proceed. I agreed
with them, hoping to arrive at Ingiga in
the evening.</p>

<p>To execute my project with greater certainty,
I intended to have recourse to my
compass, which would be a sufficient guide
in the midst of the whirlwinds. I asked
therefore, the most intelligent of my conductors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
in what direction Ingiga lay, and he
made it known to me immediately by pointing
out at a great distance a mountain, the
summit of which seemed to be lost in the
clouds. “The town,” said he, “is a little
on this side, and in the same line. We are
as yet fifty or fifty-five wersts from it.”
I interrupted him to examine in what point
of the compass it was, and to calculate with
my watch the pace we travelled. From
the time we sat out we had gone at the rate
of six or seven wersts an hour, but I considered
that the hurricane would considerably
impede us, and I counted therefore
only upon three wersts. It was now six
o’clock in the morning, and according to
my calculation, I hoped to be at Ingiga before
midnight. I learned also from my
guide, that to gain the river which led to
the town, it was first necessary that we should
arrive at a very large forest through which
it flowed. I was satisfied. The immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
extent of this wood to the right and left,
convinced me that we could not lose ourselves
or miss finding it.</p>

<p>Having taken these precautions, I told my
people that I desired nothing better than
to proceed, and that I was resolved not to
stop, whatever might happen. I recommended
to them to inform me when they
thought that they had lost their way, and
I would then set them right. The seriousness
with which I gave this order, confounded
them; they looked at each other
with an air of astonishment, not daring to
tell me in plain terms that I was out of my
senses. The most intrepid of them however,
addressed himself to me, and represented,
that having never passed this way, it
was impossible I could undertake to guide
them, without running the risk of entirely
losing them, and that I was certainly in jest.
I made no other reply than ordering every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
one to his sledge, threatening to punish
whoever should disobey, and I immediately
gave the signal to depart.</p>

<p>At half after eight we had advanced fifteen
wersts, and according to my estimate
had only forty remaining; but the horizon
had been for almost an hour covered with
dark clouds. We saw the tempest gradually
approach, and the wind began to raise
the snow in eddies. My companions were
silent. Terror acted upon them almost as
strongly as their confusion, and they knew
no longer where they were. The hurricane
soon attacked us with a violence that deranged
several of our sledges. By dint of
vociferation we rallied them. My conductors
confessed themselves conquered, and
conjured me to halt, though we were in the
open country. Blinded by the wind, which
blew in their faces, they were afraid of
misleading us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>I reminded them of my promise, and persisted
in wishing to go on. I ordered that
all the sledges should keep as close as possible
together, that we might be informed of
the least accident that should happen, and
be able to assist one another. Then, by
means of my compass, which I had fastened
under my fur cloak, that it might be continually
before my eyes, I began the office
of directing our caravan. We travelled in
this order during the rest of the day, and I
might say in the midst of darkness, for I
could not see the soldier who was in the
sledge immediately behind me, and scarcely
his foremost dogs.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock in the evening, weary
of the complaints and remonstrances of my
people, who continually requested me to
stop, and judging beside that we could not
be more than five or six wersts from the
wood, I assured them that if we did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
reach it by nine o’clock, we would go no
farther that night; unless when arrived at
the wood and the river, they preferred going
on, as we should be so near to Ingiga; but
that they should be at liberty to do as they
pleased. This condition appeared to pacify
them; not because they imagined themselves
to be so far advanced, on the contrary,
they probably considered themselves
as out of the road, and only wished to
repose themselves, that with the advantage
of day-light they might recover it
again.</p>

<p>At a quarter before nine a kind of dark
veil began to be perceptible before us. As
we drew nearer, it became blacker and more
extensive. The next moment my conductors
cried out that they could see the trees,
and that they were safe. It was in reality
the forest of Ingiga. I sent them a little
way on to examine it, and they presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
returned transported with joy to tell me
that we were close to the river.</p>

<p>The respectful tone with which they delivered
themselves diverted me extremely.
After thanking me for having guided them
so well, the Koriac asserted that none of
their chamans had ever performed any
thing so miraculous. To have predicted
the bad weather, at a time when every
thing seemed in their eyes to promise the
very reverse; to have been afterwards able
to guide and preserve them in the midst of
this <i>pourga</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, was a sagacity, in his opinion,
supernatural. The gratitude of the rest of
my company was almost equally absurd.
They could not recover themselves from
their astonishment. It was in vain I showed
them my compass, and endeavoured to explain
to them how I derived from it all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
my knowledge; they replied, that such a
conjuring book was unintelligible except
to persons like me, skilled in the art of
magic.</p>

<p>At so short a distance from Ingiga, I was
fully assured they would no longer be desirous
of stopping; each of them was anxious
to see his wife, and embrace his children.
So far were they from accepting
my proposal to pitch our tent and pass the
night in the wood, that they importuned
me to gain the river, and they engaged in
three hours to reach the town. I complied,
and we coasted along the bank till we arrived
opposite to Ingiga, where it was necessary
to cross the river, which passed close
to the walls. The ice was sufficiently firm,
but the violence of the wind had covered it
with water, so that our feet were very wet.</p>

<p>At the gates of the town I answered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
interrogatories usual in fortified places, and
was obliged to wait till a report was made
to the governor. Having long received intelligence
that I was on my way, major
Gaguen had the civility to come immediately
to welcome me, and offer me his house.
I entered Ingiga the 31, exactly at half
after eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>This town is the largest and most populous
I have yet seen. It is situated upon a
river of the same name, thirty wersts from
its mouth, and is defended by a square inclosure
of palisades, the height and thickness
of which surprised me, and by wooden
bastions, erected on piles, at the four angles.
These bastions are provided with
cannon, and contain a variety of warlike
stores. They are guarded day and night
by centinels<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, as are also the three gates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the town, of which one only is open. There
is a small square, before the house of the governor,
and a guard, stationed on one side
of this square, defends it from attack. I
was equally struck with the houses. They
are of wood, and very low, but have all a
regular front, and are evidently built upon
one plan. M. Gaguen intends by degrees
to give this uniformity to the whole town.
The isbas that have been constructed since
his arrival, besides a pleasant appearance,
have all the conveniences on the inside that
such habitations will admit of. He has it
in contemplation also to rebuild the church,
which is a wretched edifice, and almost in
ruins.</p>

<p>The population amounts to about five or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
six hundred inhabitants, who are either
merchants, or in the service of government.
The latter are most numerous, and form
the garrison of the place. They are kept
under the severest discipline, which is indispensible,
from the frequent occasion there
is to defend themselves. The circumspection
and zeal of the governor in this respect
cannot be surpassed. Their tribunals are
the same with those of Nijenei Kamtschatka.</p>

<p>The commerce of Ingiga consists of furs,
and particularly the skins of rein deer. It
is in general superior to Kamtschatka both
in the variety and quality of its skins. It
is true that we get the otter and sea wolf-skin
from that peninsula, but the sables of
Ingiga are much finer, though they are at
the same time scarcer. The Kamtschadales
besides have no common martens<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, rabbits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
or American rats, called <i>rissei</i>, which the
Koriacs get by means of exchange from the
neighbouring Tchoukchis, and which they
bring to Ingiga with their rein deer-skins.
These deer-skins are sold in their raw state,
and at a very good price. They are afterwards
tanned and manufactured with such
surprising art, that the laborious activity
of the workmen supersede the necessity of
instruments invented by European industry.
The skill and beauty of their work can only
be surpassed by its durableness. Gloves
and stockings come from their hands in a
state of perfection. Their sewings and
embroideries are wrought with the hair of
the rein deer, with silk, and with gold,
and would do credit to our most skillful
glovers.</p>

<p>But it is time I should speak of the customs
of the Koriacs. I have only deferred
my account so long that I might be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
minute. To the imperfect observations
which I have myself made in passing
through their different ostrogs, I shall add
others that are more exact, and derived
from unquestionable authority. In my conversations
with M. Gaguen and the principal
inhabitants, I endeavoured to derive
some light upon the subject; but my chief
source of information was a Koriac, whom
I shall here introduce to the reader.</p>

<p>My first acquaintance with him was at
Kaminoi. Struck with the civilities which
M. Schmaleff bestowed upon him, I was
curious to know the rank and situation of
this personage. He was, they informed me,
a <i>zassédatel</i>, or Ingiga judge, and was come
to meet us to offer us his services. The
facility with which he expressed himself in
the Russian language, and the rectitude of
his mind charmed me. I should have taken
him for a Russian, if I had not heard him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
moment after speak his native tongue. I
understood also that he was a Koriac prince,
called <i>Oumiavin</i>, and brother to one of the
chiefs of the wandering Koriacs.</p>

<p>Curiosity led me to ask him a thousand
questions. He answered with a shrewdness
and sagacity that I had not observed in any
of his countrymen. The being able to talk
with him without the assistance of an interpreter,
rendered his conversation more valuable,
and during my short stay at Kaminoi it
was a source of instruction and amusement
to me. Of the various topics upon which
we discoursed, that of religion was the most
interesting. Though equally informed respecting
the Russian and the Koriac mode
of worship, he in reality professed neither.
He seemed disposed however to be baptized,
and only waited till he was better instructed
upon certain points which he did not comprehend.
Full of admiration at the sublimity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of the Christian morals, and the majestic
pomp of its external worship, he acknowledged
that nothing could give him a
greater desire to become a convert to it;
but the imperious severity of some of our
religious rites<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, the uncertainty of celestial
happiness, and particularly the idea of a
God threatening eternal torments, filled
him with inquietude and dismay. With
all its visions and all its absurdities, the
religion of his country, he said, offered
him at least more hope than fear; its
punishments were confined to the present
world, and it promised him a recompence
in the next; the evil spirit could only
torment him during his life, and happiness
awaited him at his death. Agitated
by these considerations, his mind
floated in continual doubt and perplexity.
He dared neither abjure, nor continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
stedfast in the faith of his fathers. He
blushed at its errors, yet his heart cherished
them.</p>

<p>The simplicity with which he avowed his
irresolution, interested me the more, as I
could discover in his conversation and in his
heart, an uncommon fund of virtue, and a
singular love of truth. To fix his wavering
mind, it would have been first necessary to
clear away the prejudices that obscured it,
and which had originated from the false
principles that he had imbibed. Any other
person would perhaps have undertaken the
talk. I was deterred from it by the fear of
not succeeding in my attempt, from the
short time I should be able to spend with
him. He arrived at Ingiga the day after
me, as he had promised, and rendered me
very considerable services by his endeavour
to furnish all the information respecting his
country that I desired, and to supply me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
with what I wanted for the continuance of
my journey.</p>

<p>There is in many respects a great resemblance
between the fixed and the wandering
Koriacs: we cannot therefore but wonder
at the little cordiality, or rather at the
misunderstanding that subsists among them,
on account of which they may be considered
as two different people. Their country
however is the same, and takes in a vast
extent, terminated to the south by the
peninsula of Kamtschatka, and the gulf
of Pengina; to the east by the country
of the Oluterians; to the north by that
of the Tchoukchis, and to the west by
the Toungouses, the Lamouts, and the Yakouts.</p>

<p>It is confidently asserted that this country
was formerly very populous, but that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
small-pox had made very considerable ravages.
I doubt whether it has carried off
more of the inhabitants than their frequent
contests with their neighbours and with
the Russians. The number of fixed Koriacs
scarcely exceeds at present nine hundred;
and though it is not easy to calculate
that of the wandering Koriacs, it is
imagined that they do not much surpass
this amount.</p>

<p>The manners of the former are the reverse
of estimable, and are a mixture of duplicity
mistrust, and avarice. They have
all the vices of the northern nations of
Asia, without the virtues. Robbers by
nature, they are suspicious, cruel, incapable
either of benevolence or pity. To procure
the least service from them, it is first
necessary to offer, and even to give them
some recompence. Nothing but presents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
can excite their attention, or rouse their
activity<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>From this perfidious and savage disposition,
it would not be easy for them to
live in peace, or form any durable ties with
their neighbours. So unsociable a spirit
must also give them an abhorrence of all
foreign dominion. Hence their continual
insurrection against the Russians, their atrocious
robberies, their daily incursions on
the people who surround them; hence the
respective animosities and revenge that incessantly
spring up.</p>

<p>This state of war foments in every individual
a ferocious spirit. The practice of
attacking, and of defending themselves,
creates in them an inflexible courage that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
delights in perpetual combats, and glories
in a contempt of life. Superstition lends its
aid to ennoble in their eyes this thirst of
blood, by imposing a law that obliges them
to conquer or to die. The more important
is the cause that calls them to arms, the
more greedy are they of death. Neither
the bravery, nor the number of their adversaries,
can at all intimidate them: it is
then they swear <i>to destroy the sun</i>. They discharge
this terrible oath by cutting the
throats of their wives and children, burning
all their possessions, and rushing madly
into the midst of their enemies. The combat
can only terminate by the total destruction
of one of the parties. The vanquished
never seek their safety in flight; honour forbids
it; and not a Koriac will survive the
slaughter of his countrymen.</p>

<p>The vicinity of the Russian settlements
has hitherto produced no change in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
mode of life of the resident Koriacs. Their
commercial intercourse with the Russians,
only renders them susceptible to the attraction
of wealth, and desirous of plunder.
Insensible to the advantages of a more
polished life, they seem to feel a repugnance
to civilization, and to consider their own
manners and customs as absolutely perfect<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>Their regular occupation is hunting and
fishing; but every season will not permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
them to follow it. During these intervals,
shut up in their profound habitations, they
sleep, smoke, and get drunk. Thoughtless
of the future, without regret for the past,
they come not out of their yourts till the
most urgent necessity compels them. These
yourts are larger than those of the northern
Kamtschadales, but are distributed nearly
in the same manner. I am not sure whether
their filthiness be not still more disgusting:
as there is neither door, nor <i>joupan</i>, or vent-hole,
the smoke must be insufferable.</p>

<p>These people, enemies to industry, live
like the Kamtschadales upon dried fish, and
the flesh and fat of the whale, and sea wolf<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.
The whale is commonly eaten raw, and the
sea wolf dried and cooked in the same
manner as their fish, except the sinews, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
marrow, the brain, and now and then a
slice of the flesh, which they devour raw
with extreme avidity. Rein deer is their
favourite dish. Vegetables also form a part
of their food: they gather in autumn various
sorts of berries, of a part of which
they make themselves a refreshing beverage<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>,
and the rest is bruised to powder,
and kneaded with the oil of the whale, or
sea wolf. This paste, or sweetmeat, is called
<i>toltchoukha</i>; it is held in high esteem in this
country, but nothing is to my taste more
disagreeable.</p>

<p>Their passion for strong liquors, increased
by the dearness of brandy, and the difficulty
of procuring it on account of their
extreme distance, has led them to invent a
drink, equally potent, which they extract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
from a red mushroom, known in Russia as
a strong poison by the name of <i>moukhamorr</i><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.
They put it in a vessel with certain
fruits, and it has scarcely time to clarify
when their friends are invited to partake of
it. A noble emulation inflames the guests,
and there is a contest of who is best able to
disburden the master of the house of his
nectar. The entertainment lasts for one,
two, or three days, till the beverage is exhausted.
Frequently, that they may not
fail of being tipsy, they eat the raw mushroom
at the same time. It is astonishing
that there are not more examples of the
fatal effects of this intemperance. I have
seen however some amateurs made seriously
ill, and recovered with difficulty; but experience
does not correct them, and upon
the first occasion that offers, they return to
their brutish practice. It is not from absolute
sensuality, it is not from the pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of drinking a liquor, that by its flavour
creates an irresistible craving for more; they
seek merely in these orgies a state of oblivion,
of stupefaction, of total brutishness,
a cessation of existence, if I may so call it,
which constitutes their only enjoyment, and
supreme felicity.</p>

<p>The features of the majority of the Koriacs
are not Asiatic, and they might be
considered as Europeans, but for their low
stature, their ill shape, and the colour of
their skin. The other Koriacs have the same
characteristic outlines as the Kamtschadales;
among the women particularly, there are
very few who have not sunk eyes, flat noses,
and prominent cheeks. The men are almost
entirely beardless, and have short hair. The
hair of the women is very much neglected;
it commonly flows upon their shoulders,
though there are some who wear it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
tufts, or wrapt up in an handkerchief. Their
dress I have already described.</p>

<p>The women carry their children in a sort
of cradle, the form of which I thought
singular. It is a kind of nest or basket
arched over, in which the infant is placed
in a sitting posture, and sheltered from the
weather.</p>

<p>Among their strange customs I shall mention
the probation to which a young man
subjects himself when he is desirous of marrying.
As soon as he has fixed his choice,
he waits upon the relations of his mistress,
and offers to drudge for them, as the phrase
is. The young lady is immediately enveloped
in a multiplicity of garments, which
conceal her to such a degree, that the face
itself is scarcely visible. She is not left alone
for a single instant; her mother, and a number
of old matrons accompany her wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
she goes sleep with her, and do not
lose her from their sight upon any pretext
whatever. The aim of the lover, the point
of happiness to which all his cares tend, is
to touch her naked body, the only way by
which he can obtain her. In the mean time
he executes with zeal and submission all the
functions that the relations impose on him.
Become as it were the slave of the family,
he is employed in all the domestic labours,
to cut wood, fetch water, provide ice, &amp;c.
Love, and the presence of his intended, inspire
him with courage. If he relax, a single
look, however indifferent, is sufficient to
make him forget the fatigues and drudgery
of his servitude. The hope of abridging
its duration influences all his actions. His
eye is invariably fixed on the idol of his
heart, he watches her motions, follows her
steps, and intrudes himself incessantly in
her way. But how deceive the Argus eyes
of the duennas that surrounded her! It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
continual contest of vigilance against cunning;
each party acts with equal zeal and
perseverance. From such assiduities, from
the agitation of the lover, and the precautions
that are taken to counteract his manœuvres,
one would suppose that he was
about to carry off some extraordinary beauty.
Who would imagine that the object of
the thoughts and desires of this whining
Koriac, was ugliness itself, and that he aspired
to no other reward for so many exertions,
than to touch a callous, yellow, greasy
skin? In his leisure moments, at liberty
to see and approach his mistress, he endeavours
to merit her affection by some sly attempt
to obtain a touch; but the number
and thickness of her garments are an invincible
barrier. Enraged at so many obstacles,
he tears and pulls off this teazing dress.
Woe betide him if he be surprised in his
rash attack! The relations, the inexorable
spies, dart upon him, and force him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
relinquish his prize. It is commonly by
the eloquence of the foot, or a stick, that
they entreat him to withdraw, and find
some better opportunity. If he resist, he
is dragged by the hair, or the nails of these
old hags are imprinted on his face. If he be
disheartened, or murmurs at this cruel treatment,
he is instantly dismissed, and forfeits
for ever all claim to the alliance, which is
considered as the most signal disgrace that
can be inflicted on a Koriac lover. But difficulties
only render his desires more vehement.
Far from complaining, far from desponding
at these rigorous proceedings, he
considers himself as the more worthy of the
felicity he has in view. He rejoices, he glories
in all the tribulations he experiences
during his amorous and painful servitude.
It is frequently not till after the expiration
of two or three years, more or less, that he
obtains his end. Elate with his victory, he
flies to inform the relations of his success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
The witnesses are summoned, and the young
lady interrogated<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. Her confession is necessary,
as well as some proof that she was
taken by surprise, and made fruitless efforts
to defend herself. Her hand is then
bestowed on the conqueror, but he is obliged
still to wait till it is seen whether she can
reconcile herself to living with him. From
this moment, freed from his labours, he
makes his court without restraint to his future
wife, who is not perhaps sorry to find
herself delivered from her cumbersome attire.
This second stage of courtship is seldom
very long; the damsel, in the presence
of the family, soon accords her consent, and
nothing more is requisite to give him all the
claims of a husband. The nuptial ceremony
and feast consist merely in assembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the relations of the parties, who are eager
to get drunk in imitation of the new married
couple. A plurality of wives is not
allowed among the Koriacs; I have seen
instances however of its being practiced
without scruple.</p>

<p>Their funeral rights have a striking similarity
to the ancient institutions of paganism,
still observed by various uncivilized
people of the new hemisphere. When a
Koriac dies, his relations and neighbours
assemble to pay him their last respects.
They erect a funeral pile, upon which they
place a portion of the wealth of the deceased,
and a stock of provisions, consisting
of rein deer, fish, brandy, in short whatever
they conceive he will want for his great
journey, and to keep him from starving in
the other world. If it be a wandering Koriac,
his deer conduct him to the pile; if a
resident Koriac, he is drawn by his dogs, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
carried by his relations. The body is exhibited,
clothed in his best attire, and lying
in a kind of coffin. There it receives the
adieux of the attendants, who, with torches
in their hands, consider it as an honour
speedily to reduce their relation or friend to
ashes. They feel only the regret of a short
absence, and not of an eternal separation.
They wear no mourning, and the funeral
pomp terminates in a scene of intemperance,
where the fumes of their liquor and
tobacco gradually efface the remembrance
of death. After a few months widowhood,
the women are permitted to marry again.</p>

<p>The superstitious practices observed at
their funerals, and their transient grief at
the loss of persons the most dear to them,
are in my opinion an evident proof of their
indifference to life, the brevity of which
neither astonishes nor afflicts them. Their
religious system deadens them apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
to the consoling hope of a protracted existence.
Death is in their eyes but the passage
to another life; and in quitting the
world, they do not imagine that their pleasures
terminate, but that other enjoyments
are reserved for them. This flattering prejudice,
which I mentioned in my conversation
with Oumiavin, sufficiently accounts
for his religious perplexities, and the ferocious
courage of his countrymen. But their
absurd dogmas are entitled to a more particular
relation, though the worship upon
which they are founded is very simple, and
what is marvellous in it by no means attractive.
The following account contains
the whole theogony of the Koriacs<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p>They acknowledge a supreme being, the
creator of all things. He inhabits the sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
whose burning orb they consider as the
throne or palace of the lord of nature,
whom they probably confound with that
celestial fire, which is supposed to be his
dwelling. I am led to believe this, as they
neither fear, nor worship him. They address
no prayer to him: goodness, they say, is his
essence; all the good that exists in the world
proceeds from him; and it is impossible he
should do an injury. May we not conclude
from this statement, that the view of the
constant and universal benefits conferred by
this king of the celestial orbs which gives
life, action, and power to all things terrestrial,
while it taught them to consider this
luminary of the world as their tutelary divinity,
imbued them with the blind confidence
I have described?</p>

<p>The principle of evil they consider as
a malignant spirit, who divides with the
sovereignly good being the empire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
nature<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. Their power is equal. As the one
is intent on the happiness of mankind, the
other endeavours to render them unhappy.
Diseases, tempests, famine, calamities of
every kind, are his work, and the instruments
of his vengeance. It is to pacify his
wrath, that they sacrifice their personal interest,
and have recourse to devotion. Their
homage is dictated merely by the terror
with which this menacing deity fills every
heart, and consists of expiatory sacrifices.
They offer to him various animals, that have
just began to exist, rein deer, dogs<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
first fruits of their hunting and fishing, and
whatever they possess that is most valuable.
Their devotional exercises consist of
supplications and thanksgivings. There is
no temple, no sanctuary set apart for his
votaries. This fantastic god is equally worshipped
in all places, and hears the Koriac
who prays alone to him in the desert, as
well as the assembled family, who conceive
that they render him propitious by piously
getting drunk in their yourt; for drunkness
is become with these people a religious
practice, and the basis of all their solemnities.</p>

<p>This demon, this formidable spirit, is
doubtless the same being as the Koutka of
the Kamtschadales, whose ministers and interpreters
the chamans consider themselves.
Here, as in the peninsula, the mystic language
of these magicians works upon the
credulity, and obtains the veneration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
multitude. They exercise physic and surgery
with equal success. These exclusive
functions, which are supposed to be aided
by inspiration rather than the light of
experience, procures them an unbounded
power. They are sent for from all parts of
the country, and testimonies of gratitude
heaped upon them before-hand. They
demand with haughtiness whatever they
please, and consider every thing that is given
them as a tribute. It is upon the pretext
of making an acceptable offering to the
god, whose organ they are, that they appropriate
to themselves whatever the inhabitants
possess, that is most costly and beautiful.
It is not necessary to suppose that
these imposters gull their votaries by a parade
of virtue, by rigid observances, and a
more scrupulous life; on the contrary, they
surpass them in their vices, and fall short of
them in sobriety. On the eve of their magic
ceremonies, they pretend indeed to fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
all the day, but they make up for this abstinence
at night by a profusion of the
moukamorr, the intoxicating poison I have
described, which they eat and drink to
satiety. This preparatory intoxication they
consider as a duty. It is probable that they
feel its effects the next day, and that they
derive from it an elevation of spirits that
contributes to derange their minds, and give
them the necessary strength to go through
their extravagant transports.</p>

<p>The idiom of the Koriacs has no affinity
to that of the Kamtschadales; their pronunciation
is more shrill, and slower, but it
is less painful, and has not those uncommon
sounds, those hissings, as difficult to be uttered
as they are to be written.</p>

<p>I have still to give an account of the
wandering Koriacs; but not satisfied with
the information I have obtained upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
subject, I shall wait till my arrival at the
house of Oumiavin’s brother, where I shall
have an opportunity of ascertaining its
truth, by comparing it with the objects that
will be immediately before my eyes.</p>

<p>From the time of my arrival at Ingiga,
M. Gaguen, in compliance with my entreaties,
had been employed upon the means
of hastening my departure as much as possible.
Had it depended on myself, I should
not have stopped more than twenty-four
hours; but unfortunately my dogs were
fatigued, and there were very few to be
procured throughout the whole town, and
these not in the best condition<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
therefore proposed to me to take rein deer,
which I accepted the more readily, as I
hoped to travel the quicker, and as I had
long been desirous of trying this mode of
conveyance. I was not left in ignorance of
the inconvenience attending it. I had to
expect greater risks, more fatigue, and less
repose; but my impatience made me regardless
of every thing but the possibility
of proceeding, and the pleasure of being
able to judge for myself of the speed of
these animals.</p>

<p>To satisfy my impatience, and enable me
to continue my journey without interruptions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
M. Gaguen resolved to concert with
the chiefs of the wandering Koriacs that
were in the neighbourhood, and accordingly
sent to invite them to his house. Two days
after, twelve of these princes arrived, and a
number of other Koriacs, who had received
similar invitations.</p>

<p>After the usual compliments<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, he presented
me to the assembly, explaining to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
them, in a few words, by an interpreter,
who I was, the importance of my embassy,
and the necessity in which I stood of their
assistance. This short explanation excited
a general murmur. It was in vain M.
Gaguen alledged the absolute orders of
government respecting me; their clamours
increased to such a degree, that it was impossible
to be heard, or to learn the cause of
their discontent. At last, amidst this confused
noise, it was understood that they
complained of all the labour of the averages
falling upon them, while the fixed Koriacs
were exempt from any share in it. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
claim had they to this over bearing immunity?
By what privilege, like idle drones,
should they be allowed to vegetate in their
yourts? Why not, like them, be subjected
to the conveyance of travellers? These remonstrances,
justly founded, but peevishly
urged, began to alarm me respecting the
success of my demand, when an aged prince
rose up: “Is this,” cried he, “the fit time
to make our complaints? If our zeal be
abused, is this stranger responsible for it?
Has he the less claim to our good offices?
He shall have my assistance, and I will
conduct him as far as he shall think necessary.
Consent only to escort him to
my house. There are surely some among
you who will render him this trifling
service.”</p>

<p>Upon this short address, shame was visible
in the countenance of the whole assembly,
and the most mutinous were silent. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
a moment’s pause, every one attempted to
exculpate himself from the reproach which
he feared he had merited, and there was
an emulation who should have the preference
of conducting the stranger and his
attendants to the <i>Stoudénaïa-reka</i>, or cold
river, upon the border of which lived the
obliging Koriac, who had voluntarily proffered
his services. Every difficulty being
thus removed, my departure was fixed for
5 April, and the whole company engaged
to attend my orders on that day. The old
prince, who had so generously pleaded my
cause, was the first to withdraw from my
thanks, upon the pretext of having various
preparations to make before my arrival.
How great was my joy to learn, that the
person to whom I owed this change of disposition
in my favour, was the brother of
Oumiavin, whose acquaintance I had so ardently
desired!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>From this instant, M. Gaguen put every
thing in motion for my departure. A number
of small wheaten loaves were made
under his immediate inspection, and a supply
of rye biscuit. A variety of eatables,
reserved for his own use, was, in spite of my
remonstrances, packed up with my baggage.
He added also several presents, which
I was obliged to accept, from the polite and
friendly manner in which they were offered.
In short, I know not how to enumerate all
his kindnesses to me. Every hour, during
my stay with him, was marked by an attention
to my wishes and an endeavour to
oblige. His cares contributed equally with
my repose to re-establish my health, which
had been in no very enviable state since the
cold I had caught upon leaving Poustaretsk.</p>

<p>Prepared to depart 5 April, as had been
agreed, how great was my surprise to see
none of my conductors arrive! Various expresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
were sent off; but the whole day
passed before we had any intelligence. It
was night when they made their appearance,
each alledging that the delay had been
unavoidable.</p>

<p>The next day there was a new obstacle.
It was Sunday, and the timorous consciences
of my soldiers made them averse to
travelling. Was it necessary to attend to
this scruple, or rather this terror? for it
was superstition more than devotion; it was
not the sacredness of the day that influenced
them, but the idea that they should meet
with some misfortune. Notwithstanding
the care I took to attend a Russian mass with
them, they were not to be prevailed on to
set out. After various intreaties to no purpose,
I was obliged to stay and dine with
M. Gaguen, who politely congratulated
himself upon the delay. Finding, however,
that it deprived me of all enjoyment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
he proposed to cure my people of their chimerical
fears. I defied him, and he accepted
my challenge. Immediately he ordered
brandy to be profusely dealt out to all my
attendants, Russians as well as Koriacs. Imperceptibly
their heads were warmed, and
gaiety made them forgetful of the pretended
danger. The most reluctant were
the first to assist in harnessing the deer. It
was no sooner said than done, and my sledges
were ready in an instant.</p>

<p>During this interval, a scene took place
that diverted me extremely. Oumiavin,
out of compliment to me, became completely
fuddled. The vivacity of his regrets
led him to practice every species of
absurdity, which he called taking leave of
me. He went out, came in again, officiously
assisted in every thing. My sledge was no
sooner ready than he must lift it, to judge
of its weight; but unable to keep himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
steady, this good Koriac fell, and in falling,
broke the point of my sabre. His grief, at
the sight of this trifling accident, was truly
poignant. He precipitated himself at my
feet, which he embraced, and washed with
his tears, conjuring me not to depart till I
had forgiven him. I attempted to raise
him, and assured him of my friendship;
but he persisted in his posture, and his tears
continued to flow. It was not till half an
hour, that, by means of entreaties and kindnesses,
I was able to pacify him.</p>

<p>I came out of the town on foot, escorted
by almost all the inhabitants, who were desirous,
they said, of doing honour to the
only Frenchman that had ever visited them.
M. Gaguen, and the officers of the garrison,
insisted upon conducting me to the gates,
where, having repeated my thanks for their
civilities, we separated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the four soldiers who composed my
suite when I left Kaminoi, two only remained
with me, Golikoff and Nedarezoff;
I had left the others at Ingiga, which was
the place of their residence. Upon the recommendation
however of M. Gaguen, I accepted
the services of a young merchant,
who asked leave to accompany me as far as
Okotsk. During my abode at Ingiga, I had
had frequent opportunities of conversing
with him, and knowing the value of his society,
and considered myself as fortunate
in meeting with so agreeable a companion.</p>

<p>It was to no purpose that I had prepared
to guide my own sledge; every one opposed
me, from the fear that the want of knowledge
and skill as to my new steeds, might occasion
me some fatal accident; they had beside
been expressly injoined not to permit me,
during the first day at least. When I came
to my vehicle, I found my guide already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
seated in front, and I took my place, without
paying any attention to him; but upon
his looking round, I recognized in his features
a Koriac prince, named <i>Eviava</i>. He
was eager to express his joy in having the
honour to conduct me, and then prepared
to join the file.</p>

<p>I have long owed the reader a description
of a Koriac sledge, and am now able to
satisfy his curiosity. The picture, I hope,
will be sufficiently interesting to obtain his
pardon for the delay.</p>

<p>Upon two skates, placed parallel to each
other, that is, upon two branches of a tree,
six feet and an half long, three inches wide,
and very roughly finished, the extremities
of which in front are bent upwards in the
form of a demi-crescent, is placed the body
of the sledge, which is really nothing more
than a frame of open work, five feet long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and eighteen inches wide, raised two feet
and a few inches above the ground. Two
small poles, about five inches in circumference,
constitute the frame of this vehicle,
the minuter parts of which are formed of
thick laths, inserted the one in the other.
A cross bar, more substantial than these
poles, unites their forward extremities,
which are prolonged to the arches of the
skates, and fastened to them with leathern
thongs. The lower part of this open work
rests upon a sort of curvilinear feet, the
lower ends of which, spreading out, are inserted
in the skates, and the back is constructed
in the form of an open calash, being
sixteen inches high and twenty-four
deep, disposed in a semi-circular form, with
short poles ranged at the top, in the perforations
of a demi-hoop, nearly like the
backs of our arm chairs in a garden. In
this narrow inclosure, the traveller commonly
places his provisions, or whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
else is destined for continual use. For myself,
I employed it to receive my box of
dispatches, and seated myself upon it till
the moment that I took the place of my
guide. His seat is towards the middle of
the open work, not far from the cross bar;
here he places himself astride, with his feet
resting upon the skates of the sledge.</p>

<p>The team consists of two rein deer placed
abreast, with no other harness than a leathern
collar, which passes across the breast and
between the fore legs of the animal, and is
fastened to his flank by a thong, in the manner
of a trace, so that that which belongs
to the deer on the right, is fastened to the
cross bar of the sledge, and that which belongs
to the deer on the left, to the bottom
of one of the bent supporters of the carriage,
and on the same side. As reins, they
have two slender thongs, one end of which
is twisted about the root of the horns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the deer<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. When they want to go to the
right, they pull the rein gently in this direction,
giving at the same time a sort of
back handed lash to the animal on the left.
When they want to go to the left, they give
two or three smart shakes to the right rein,
touching at the same time the deer to which
it belongs. The left rein has no other use
than as a curb to the deer to which it is
fastened. The driver has also a stick, one
end of which is armed with a sort of hammer.
The head of the instrument consists
of an horizontal bone, one of whose extremities
is very sharp, and is principally used
to disengage the traces of the deer, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
they are going on, if they happen to become
entangled about their feet; and this
is considered as one of the nicest accomplishments
of a driver. The other end of
the bone is round and blunted, and serves
the purpose of a whip; but the blows that
are given with it are much more severe; and
are beside distributed so liberally, that the
poor animals are sometimes covered with
streams of blood. These sticks are very
apt to break, and they therefore take care
to provide themselves with a number of
them, which are fastened lengthwise to the
sledge.</p>

<p>We travelled very slowly till the evening.
The only inconvenience I felt was the
not being able, for want of an interpreter,
to enjoy the conversation of my princely
guide. It doubtless deprived me of a fund
of information which it was in his power to
have furnished, and our mutual taciturnity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
did not render my journey the more pleasant.</p>

<p>We stopped at seven o’clock. It was necessary
to gain a mountain well known to
our Koriacs, and which had been marked
in our itinerary as our first stage. I should
in vain have wished to seek shelter in a
wood, as had been my custom when drawn
by dogs. The convenience of the traveller
is left out of the account in the choice of a
resting place; that of the rein deer only is
consulted, and the spot that most abounds
with moss is invariably preferred. Half way
up the mountain our steeds were unharnessed,
and no other care taken of them than
that of tying them with leathern thongs.
I saw them instantly scrape away the snow,
under which they well knew how to come
at their food. At a short distance we made
a fire, and set on our kettle, and the length
of our supper answered to its frugality. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
admitted my Koriac prince to my mess,
who appeared to be highly flattered with
the honour. I then laid myself down on
the snow, and was permitted to sleep a few
hours; but when the time was expired, they
awoke me without compunction to proceed
on our journey.</p>

<p>It is necessary to observe that the Koriacs
will travel four, five, or six days incessantly
without taking scarcely any repose. The
rein deer are habituated to run day and
night. In every two or three hours they
are unharnessed, and allowed the interval
of an hour to feed, after which they set off
again with equal ardour; and this mode is
repeated till they arrive at the end of the
journey. It may be supposed from this account,
that I considered myself as fortunate,
when the night came, to be indulged with
two hours uninterrupted sleep. The favour
however was not long accorded to me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
by degrees I was obliged to accustom myself
to the practice of my inflexible conductors,
though it was not without extreme difficulty.</p>

<p>Before I remounted, Eviava informed me
that he was under the necessity of lightening
our vehicle, the weight of two persons
being for a continuance too much for our
steeds, and that if I wished to make the
experiment of being my own charioteer, he
would take one of the empty sledges, with
which we were furnished as a resource in
case of accident, or the loss of any of our
deer. The proposal coincided too well with
my inclination for me to hesitate a moment
in accepting it, and I instantly seized the
reins, and began my new apprenticeship.</p>

<p>I found it equally arduous with that to
which I subjected myself at Bolcheretsk,
with this difference, that I was then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
first to laugh at the frequency of my falls;
whereas in the present case, I obtained the
conviction of their danger at the risk of my
life. The trace of the deer on the left, being
fastened to the supporter of the sledge
on the corresponding side, nearly touches
the left foot of the conductor, who must be
continually on his guard to keep clear of
it. From forgetfulness or inexperience, I
failed in this precaution, and my leg became
entangled. The violence of my fall,
or more probably the sudden and acute
pain I felt in my leg, led me imprudently
to relinquish my hold of the reins, in order
to apply my hand to it. By what
means could I disengage myself? The deer,
finding no longer the same restraint, advanced
with greater speed, and every effort
I made to get free encouraged and
irritated them. Dragged along in this
manner, my head sweeping the snow and
striking continually against the skate of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
sledge, and feeling every moment as if my
leg would be shivered in pieces, it is scarcely
conceivable what I suffered. I was no longer
able to cry out; I had lost all consciousness;
when, by a motion purely mechanical,
I extended my left hand exactly upon the
reins that floated by chance. A new jolt
of the sledge made me draw back my hand,
and this involuntary check stopped my
deer. Some of my people came up at the
same time, expecting to find me either dangerously
wounded, or already deprived of
life. Meanwhile after a swoon of a few
minutes, my senses returned, and I recovered
my strength. The only injury I
sustained was a violent contusion on my
leg, and a head-ache, which were attended
with no very material consequences. The
joy of having escaped from this danger,
gave me additional courage, and I ascended
my sledge, and pursued my journey as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Become more circumspect, I took care in
future whenever I was overturned, to check
immediately my deer, for I ought to consider
myself as fortunate that, in their impetuosity,
they did not proceed with me to the mountains<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.
In that case how could they have
been stopped? Three or four days are frequently
spent in this pursuit, and sometimes
without success. This intelligence,
which I received from my Koriacs, made
me tremble for my dispatches, which were
in a box fastened to my sledge, and were
thus liable to be taken from me every
moment.</p>

<p>I perceived at the left of our road the
village of Karbanda, situated on the sea-coast,
and ninety wersts from Ingiga. We
did not pass nearer than a werst to it, and
it appeared to be a very inconsiderable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
ostrog. Three wersts farther on I saw two
yourts and six balagans, which are occupied
only in summer.</p>

<p>We had still seven wersts to the place
destined for our halt, which was a wretched
hamlet in the middle of a small wood watered
by the river Noyakhona. It consists
of a single yourt and three or four balagans,
inhabited winter and summer by ten
or twelve Koriacs, who gave me a tolerable
reception; for they sheltered me at least;
and this was no trifling convenience to a
man frequently obliged to sleep in the open
air, and upon a bed of snow.</p>

<p>About two o’clock in the morning we
sent for our deer, which had been conducted
to a distance from the hamlet, that they
might have an opportunity of feeding, and
be out of the reach of the dogs. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
pursued our journey, but the day afforded
nothing interesting.</p>

<p>In the evening, Eviava, who was not well
acquainted with the situation of the yourt
of Oumiavin’s brother, proposed to me to
ascend a mountain at the left, where he
expected to find one of his countrymen that
could direct us. In the space of an hour
and an half we reached the summit, but
upon looking round, could perceive no trace
of an habitation. The night would not
permit us to extend our search. Perceiving
that I was tired and little disposed to go
any farther, Eviava was unhappy. To satisfy
him, I desired that he would make
the search without me, and that I would
in the mean time, repose myself in this place
till his return. In about three hours he
came with joy to awake me. He had found
his friend, prince Amoulamoula and all his
herd. They entreated me not to quit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
place where I was till the next morning,
being all desirous of coming to meet me. I
was not sorry for the event, as it procured
me almost a whole night’s rest.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light my visitors came.
The chief approached me first, to pay me
his compliments in the Koriac mode. He
accompanied them with a beautiful black
and red fox skin, or <i>sevadouschka</i>, which he
drew from his parque, and obliged me to
accept<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. In return for this civility, I
treated them all with brandy and tobacco,
with which I had amply provided myself
at Ingiga; and having thanked them for
their kindness, I took my leave, supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
with the necessary information to direct our
course.</p>

<p>Though the snow was very deep, and
not at all firm, our deer ran with surprising
ease and lightness. Having broader
feet, they do not sink so much as the dogs,
and have in this respect the advantage, as
there is no necessity of going before them
with rackets to clear the way. But then
the dogs are not so soon tired, and spare
the traveller the disagreeable circumstance
of stopping every two or three hours.</p>

<p>In my way I killed a number of partridges.
From the quantity we saw, these
cantons must be congenial to them. Some
wild rein deer fled upon our approach with
a velocity that scarcely gave me time to observe
them. Happily the abundance of my
provisions took from me all desire to kill
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>At noon we could distinguish the Stoudenaïa-reka,
and in an hour after we had
crossed it, or rather we were arrived at
the yourt of the brother of Oumiavin, in
whose hands Eviava had undertaken to
place me.</p>

<p>My new host came to meet me at the
head of his family. Their satisfaction at
seeing me was visible in their countenances,
and they seemed to strive who should press
closest. The address of the old prince was
short, but replete with the cordiality which
he had before demonstrated. Every thing
he had was at my disposal, and I might
command the services of himself and his
family. They immediately began to place
my sledges and effects under cover. I had
no other care than that of my dispatches,
and before they would permit me to have
even this trouble, I was obliged to explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to them that I never trusted this box out of
my own hands.</p>

<p>When I entered the yourt, my first care
was to pay prince Eviava my post expences.
I had twelve sledges, each drawn by two
deer; the distance we had travelled was a
hundred and eighty-five wersts; and I was
indebted therefore seven roubles forty kopecks.
In receiving this sum, my good
conductor exclaimed upon my generosity.
It was in vain I endeavoured to prove that
I paid him no more than his just due; he
could not comprehend my calculation; and
it was the continual burden of his song, that
he had never met with so honest a man. To
pay him for having conferred an obligation
upon me, was in his opinion an act of
sublime virtue. So many encomiums, give
room for suspicion that the Russians practice
something more than œconomy; and
it is asserted, that their travelling in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
country is not attended with much expence.</p>

<p>We sat down to our dinner, which was
very joyous. Eviava and my host eat with
me; the brandy was not spared; and my
enchanted guests never remembered to have
fared so sumptuously.</p>

<p>I employed the rest of the day in making
observations, and interrogating the people
about me. But the reader may have perhaps
the curiosity to know something more
of the brave Koriac who received me with so
good a grace.</p>

<p>His name also is Oumiavin, but he is
distinguished from his brother by that of
Simeon, in which he was baptized when an
infant. He confessed to me with the utmost
frankness, that he had no idea of the
nature of the Christian religion. So little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
care had been taken to instruct this young
proselyte, that he was ignorant of the very
first principles of the gospel. Accustomed
to an absurd mixture of the errors of his
country, and a few external practices of
Christianity to which he had habituated
himself<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, he happily found in his heart the
principles of natural rectitude, by which
alone his conduct was governed.</p>

<p>Like all the Koriacs, he is small and sallow.
His head is characteristic of his mind.
An expression of frankness and benevolence,
confirmed by the whole of his figure, prejudices
us in his favour; and his short white
locks, added to the regularity of his features,
give him an air of true distinction.
He is lame of his right-arm, in consequence
of an obstinate contest with a bear. His
companions fled through fear, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
left alone to oppose the monster, and though
he had no other weapon but his knife, he
defeated and killed him. The chace is his
favourite amusement. Equally skilful and
intrepid, he is regarded also as a very fortunate
hunter.</p>

<p>But it is the strength of his mind, that
renders him most estimable and interesting.
The project he formed, and which he laments
the not having been permitted to
execute, could only have been dictated by
a head strongly organised. It proves at
least much good sense and deeper reflection
than can be ascribed to the rest of his
countrymen. It originated thus.</p>

<p>Indocile and jealous of its liberty, this
people had for a long time impatiently
brooked the idea of being tributary to
Russia. The severe administration of the
governors was accused by this savage tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
as being a tyrannical abuse of power; and
doubtless, among the numerous subaltern
officers there were many who felt no compunction
in harassing these new subjects of
the empress.</p>

<p>Simeon Oumiavin was the first whose
indignation was roused. More enraged at
the obduracy of these extortioners, than at
what was taken for them, it was impossible,
he said, they could be authorised by a sovereign
whose justice and lenity were incessantly
vaunted. This judicious reflexion
made the strongest impression upon his
mind, and awakened all his natural courage.
Immediately assembling a few of
his countrymen, who, like himself, were
victims of the iniquity of these petty tyrants,
he communicated to them his suspicions,
and his design.</p>

<p>“My brethren,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a><br /><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> “do you feel
the weight of your chains? Were you
born to wear them, to be the prey of
these avaricious rulers, whose rapacity,
abusing every day the power entrusted
to them, leads them to regard us as a
property which they may squander at
their pleasure? How do we hope to deliver
ourselves from this scourge? We
cannot have recourse to arms; we are
too weak; and new and more formidable
enemies would spring up from the ashes
of the dead. But we dare pass the immense
tract of country which they traversed
to come to us; we dare carry our
complaints to the palace of our sovereign.
It is in her name, but not by her order,
that we are harassed, that we are robbed.
The mildness of her government gives the
lie to such injurious treatment, such perfidies.
Her licentious ministers are the
most forward to boast of its lenity. Let
us go in person to claim it, throw ourselves
at her feet, and declare our grievances.
She is our common mother, and
will not turn a deaf ear to the cries of a
part of her subjects, of whom she can have
no knowledge but from the false accounts
of her wicked agents.”</p>

<p>This speech, which I have reported nearly
as it was delivered to me by Oumiavin, inspired
every mind with the indignation and
enthusiasm of its author. It was a zealous
contest among them who should go to Petersburg.
Meanwhile the most wealthy and
intrepid were selected for the office. Oumiavin,
from his ability to speak with tolerable
readiness the Russian language, had
the honour of being placed at the head of
the deputation, and they departed, furnished
with a variety of valuable articles which
were intended as presents. Arrived at
Okotsk, our travellers stood in need of succour.
They applied to the governor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
intreating him to supply them with the
means of gaining Irkoutsk at least. He had
got some intelligence of their design, and
foreseeing its danger, took measures to prevent
it. Under the specious pretext of first
obtaining the consent of the governor general,
he detained them several months.
During this interval, he employed every
means to seduce them. Reasonings, intreaties,
kindness, every thing was resorted
to; but nothing could dissuade them from
continuing their journey; they were inflexible.
Violence was then made use of;
a thousand snares were spread for them; it
was easy for monopoly and persecution to
create wrongs; and as a punishment, they
were constrained to return, with the shame
and mortification of having sacrificed to no
purpose the greatest part of their wealth,
and their deer.</p>

<p>This melancholy experience discouraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
not the chief of the Koriac confederacy; it
was in his eyes an additional proof of the
utility of his design, and the necessity of
executing it. From this moment he treasured
up the remembrance of it, hoping
that more fortunate circumstances would
one day offer. At the time of my visit, his
heart was still inflamed with the desire of
undertaking this expedition. “Yes,” said
he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> “in spite of my age, I would set off
this moment. My motive indeed would
be different, and I should no longer have
the same obstacles to fear, as our present
governors are entitled to our confidence
and praises. My ambition would be to
see my sovereign. I endeavour sometimes
to form an idea of her splendid palace,
and the wealth and variety with which it
abounds, and it revives my regret at not
having been permitted to behold her in
all her magnificence and glory. We
should have considered her as a divinity,
and the faithful account we should have
given to our countrymen, would have
filled every heart with respect and submission.
Influenced still more forcibly by
love, than we had before been by fear, we
should cheerfully have paid every tribute
imposed by moderation. We should have
taught our neighbours to venerate her
government, by making them the witnesses
of our satisfaction and gratitude.”</p>

<p>Almost my whole conversation with this
honest Koriac was of this nature. I considered
myself as bound to transcribe it in
this place, to give the fuller description of
his character. I beg leave to add another
anecdote.</p>

<p>The expences he had incurred had nearly
ruined him. A considerable time was necessary
to repair his flock, which, from the
neglect and infidelity of the keepers, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
during his absence fallen into decay. It was
at this very moment that he gave a striking
proof of his generosity. One of his relations
had some months before lost all his deer,
and was reduced to servitude. Simeon Oumiavin
came to his assistance, and made up
for him a small flock which he lent him
without interest. On his return from his
fatal embassy, he refused to take it back,
because it was not yet sufficiently augmented
to leave his friend wherewith to support
himself.</p>

<p>Their deer is the only source of riches to
this wandering people. The chief of a
horde has seldom less than two or three
hundred, and many of them have three or
four thousand. Oumiavin’s flock amounted,
when I was with him, to about eight or
nine hundred, the view of which afforded
me very great pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>This multitude of deer are seen on the
top of a mountain, near the Stoudenaïa-reka,
sometimes collected, and sometimes
scattered, seeking under the snow for moss.
It is seldom that any of them wander from
the flock, and they are always caught without
difficulty. On the evening of my arrival
I had an opportunity of enjoying this
spectacle. They had been assembled in order
to select what were necessary for my use,
which required only a quarter of an hour.
Upon a particular cry of their keepers, the
tame deer came towards us. The young
ones, and those which are unaccustomed to,
or exempt from, labour, go off in a different
direction. The slow and the restive ones
were next separated from the rest, and those
that were wanted were easily caught by
means of a running noose which they threw
over them with singular dexterity. The
choice being made, they separated those
destined for my use, and which if they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
not been detained by force, would speedily
have gone to rejoin the rest.</p>

<p>They do not ordinarily employ in labour
the female deer, which are reserved for the
propagation of the species. They are coupled
in autumn, and foal in the spring.
The young males designed for draught, are
castrated nearly in the same manner as the
dogs of Kamtschatka.</p>

<p>There are almost always three or four
deer in a flock that are trained for the chace.
The instinct of these animals is inconceivable;
they hunt even while they are feeding.
If a tame deer perceives a wild one,
he immediately, without showing any sign
either of joy or surprise, imitates in browsing
the gait and manner of the other, who
sometimes approaches him without suspecting
a snare. Presently one sees them play
together; their horns become entangled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
they part, they join each other again, they
fly and pursue each other by turns. In
these sportive amusements the tame deer
gradually draws his prey within musquet
shot of the hunter. With a well managed
deer, one is able to seize his companion alive;
a cord is hung upon the horns of the former,
which, in their play, he entangles in
the horns of his adversary. From that time
the greater the efforts made by the wild
deer to escape, the closer the running knot
is drawn, and the more strongly the tame
deer pulls at the cord, in order to give his
master time to come up. It frequently happens
however that the wild deer suspects
the trick, and escapes the danger by flight.</p>

<p>When a Koriac comes out of his yourt in
the morning, the deer flock about him in
expectation of a drink, which is the highest
treat to them; this is nothing more than
human urine, which is carefully preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
in vessels, or hampers made of straw, and
of so nice a contexture that the liquor cannot
penetrate through them. The flock
are so extremely fond of this beverage, that
whatever quantity you give them, it is all
swallowed in an instant.</p>

<p>Simeon Oumiavin ordered a young deer
to be killed, the best of his flock. It
was cut up for my use, and the half of
a wild deer added to it, the flesh of which
appeared to be still more succulent. He
gave me also four very beautiful skins<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.
We then entered the yourt, where I passed
the night upon a mattrass spread in one
corner.</p>

<p>Though the appellation be the same,
there is no kind of resemblance between the
habitations of the wandering, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
underground dwellings of the fixed Koriacs.
Not knowing how to distinguish the different
lodgings of these people, the Russians
have given the name of yourt to all
of them, without troubling themselves with
the primitive signification of the word,
which means a subterraneous apartment.
The yourts in question are, properly speaking,
mere tents in the form of huts placed
on the surface of the ground. No other
care is taken as to the foundations, than that
of drawing the boundary, and removing the
snow that may be within the line. Round
the circumference, a number of poles are
erected at equal distances, which uniting at
the top, serve as supports to each other.
This rustic timber work has a wretched
covering, of tanned deer skins, extended
from the base<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> to within a foot or two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the summit, which is left open for the
admission of air, and as a passage for the
smoke. A considerable inconvenience results
from this circumstance, as there is
nothing to protect the centre of the habitation
from the rain and the snow; in the
mean time it is on this very spot they make
their fire, and cook their victuals. The
family, and the servants, who have the care
of the flocks, sleep under <i>pologs</i>, which are
a kind of huts, or low tents ranged in distinct
apartments round the wall of the
yourt, and resembling the square tents of
the Tchouktchis.</p>

<p>The unsettled state of these wandering
people led them to invent this species of habitation.
The conveyance of their whole
house being equally easy and commodious,
they feel the less reluctance to changing
their quarters. Upon the first necessity or
inconvenience, they take up their tents, fasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the poles lengthwise to the sledges, and stow
the coverings with their baggage. A new
spot is fixed upon, and deserted again almost
immediately, and thus they remove from
one place to another every moment. Their
sledges are of course always kept loaded by
the side of their habitations, and the provision
and other articles taken out in proportion
as they want them.</p>

<p>On my arrival I found twelve sledges prepared
for me. The first care of Simeon
Oumiavin was to assure me, that he would
himself be my guide, and would conduct
me, if it were necessary, as far as Yamsk.
I manifested a becoming sense of this obliging
offer, and at eight o’clock in the morning
of 10 April, we took our flight, and at
noon had reached the Tavatoma, being a
space of twenty-five wersts.</p>

<p>Desirous of seeing a hot spring which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Oumiavin pointed out to me in the neighbourhood,
I put on my rackets to cross on
foot a small wood, by the side of which it
forms a stream three fathom wide, which
pours itself into the Tavatoma. I left my
people therefore at an elbow, formed by the
river at this place, and it was agreed that
they should proceed over a high mountain
that was at the right, and take the opportunity
while they waited for me, of feeding
the deer, and preparing our dinner. Accompanied
only by M. Kisselioff, I travelled
two wersts to reach the spring.</p>

<p>It is said to be composed of a number of
others issuing from a mountain at the left of
the river, and which unite in their descent.
A thick smoke rises in clouds above these
waters, but it has no offensive smell. The
heat is extreme, and the bubbling continual.
Their taste is sharp and disagreeable, which
seems to imply that the waters contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
sulphurous and saline particles; by analising
them, they would probably also be found to
have iron and copper. It is certain that the
stones we picked up along the stream had
all a volcanic quality, but the most singular
circumstance was the effect the water produced
upon us. I merely, in a slight manner,
washed my mouth with it, and M. Kisselioff
his face; he had the skin of his face
taken off, and I had my tongue and palate
flayed, and for a long time was unable to
eat any thing hot or high seasoned.</p>

<p>Having satisfied my curiosity, we prepared
to join our company. To effect this, we
imagined that we were to pass a mountain
opposite to that from which the hot spring
issued. Our rackets made us retreat instead
of advancing, and we were obliged to take
them off, and ascend by the help of our
hands and feet. About three fourths of
the way, overcome with fatigue, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
apprehensive that we had mistaken the road,
I intreated my companion, who was more
accustomed to this mode of climbing upon
the snow, to endeavour to gain the summit,
from whence I hoped he would be able to
discover our equipage. He succeeded, and
after waiting an hour and half in anxiety,
I saw the good Koriac coming with a sledge
to my assistance. We had in reality taken
the wrong direction, he informed me, and
Kisselioff had been ten times on the point
of perishing before he found our camp.
Upon my arrival we proceeded immediately
on our journey, and did not halt till it was
late, and we were twenty-five wersts from
the hot springs of Tavatoma.</p>

<p>We had determined the 11, to push for
the chain of mountains called <i>Villeguinskoi-khrebeut</i>,
but it was not practicable. At the
close of day we could but just perceive
them; we advanced however till we came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
near enough to be sure of reaching them
early in the morning.</p>

<p>They appeared to be close to us, when we
were still at the distance of eight wersts.
Having passed this place, we had to cross a
small river that winds at the bottom of these
mountains, when we came to that of Villegui,
which is the loftiest, and gives its name
to the rest. At first sight it appeared to be
inaccessible. A narrow passage presented
itself, and, confiding in my princely conductor,
we entered it. Four hours scarcely
sufficed to bring us to the peak. Conceive
of an enormous mass, at least two hundred
yards high, and nearly perpendicular, with
rocks and stones projecting in various places,
and cleared by the hurricanes from the snow.
The little that remained made the footing
so slippery that our deer fell down every
moment. In spite of our exertions to support
the sledges, the steepness of the declivity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
made them recoil, and we were under
the continual apprehension of their falling
upon us, which would infallibly have happened
if we had slipped. Frequently in
laying hold of a rock that seemed to adhere
to the mass, it gave way, and I lost my
equilibrium. But for Oumiavin and my
soldiers, who were by my side, and gave me
timely assistance, I should infalliably have
precipitated to the bottom. Arrived at the
summit, I became giddy upon looking down
the precipice I had climbed, and my heart
shuddered at the danger I had escaped.</p>

<p>I was far from thinking myself safe, as I
had to descend. My obliging Koriac, to
give me confidence, minutely explained the
method I was to take, and his instruction
freed me from all fear of accidents; but I
was still uneasy, having left a part of my
baggage at the foot of the mountain. Who,
thought I to myself, will have the courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
to go for it? The intrepid Oumiavin undertook
the office, attended by some of his
people.</p>

<p>I was tormented by a burning thirst. The
top of the mountain was covered with snow,
but how were we to dissolve it, as there was
not a shrub to be seen? The hope of finding
some at the bottom made me resolve not to
wait for my guide, but to avail myself of
his lessons, and descend. We began by unharnessing
our deer, and fastening them to
the back part of our sledges, in each of
which two men placed themselves. We
then slid down in the manner of the inhabitants
of Petersburg, who, during the carnival,
thus amuse themselves upon the mountains
of ice which they form on the Neva.
With the aid of our sticks we guided and
kept back our vehicles, and in less than ten
minutes we were safe. I had the good fortune
to perceive some small cedars, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
fire having been kindled, I allayed my thirst.
It was now two o’clock, and at seven we
were all assembled; Oumiavin met with no
accident, but he was so fatigued that it was
nine before we could proceed.</p>

<p>The next day’s journey was less painful
to us than to our deer. The snow was
more than three feet deep, and so little firm
that they sunk to their necks. Many of
them refused to draw, and it was necessary
to leave them behind us. Such is the inconvenience
attending these animals, when
one wishes to make a long journey with
only short intervals of rest; as soon as they
are tired, we must abandon them or stop;
it is no longer possible make them move.</p>

<p>I had hoped to reach Toumané in the
morning of 14, and we were within ten
wersts of it, when a violent gale of wind,
accompanied with snow, almost blinded us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
It obliged us to relax our speed, and we did
not enter the village till four o’clock in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>It is situated south-west of Ingiga, at the
distance of four hundred and forty wersts,
in a little wood through which the river
Toumané flows. Three yourts, an equal
number of wooden magazines, and a dozen
balagans make up the whole ostrog, the population
of which amounts to twenty families.
Though the river abounds with
fish<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>, I saw the inhabitants, either from indolence,
or a vitious taste, feed upon the
bark of the birch tree steeped in the oil of
the whale.</p>

<p>The bad weather continued during the
15 and 16; but it would have been impossible
to have proceeded if we had been
ever so desirous, as our deer were incapable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of drawing us any farther. Oumiavin dared
not avow it, but his melancholy appearance
told me what he would willingly have
concealed. Upon my mentioning it to him,
he began to make apologies, as if I had a
right to complain, because he found it impossible
to conduct me, as he had intended,
as far as Yamsk. I had much difficulty to
make him understand that I was fully satisfied
of his good will, and owed him my
thanks for all his civilities; it was necessary
to assume an air of displeasure before he
would accept some presents that I thought
myself bound to add to my post expences.</p>

<p>By his advice, I intreated the inhabitants
to supply me with what dogs they had, but
with all their efforts they could only procure
me a very small number, and there was no
other way of making up what I wanted,
than that of harnessing young dogs, and
even females that were ready to whelp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
The generosity of these people was carried
so far as to offer me a part of their dried
fish, of which they had no abundance.</p>

<p>The 17 the wind abated, but the sky was
covered with black, and very ill boding
clouds. In the mean time having taken
leave of Simeon Oumiavin, and my Toumané
hosts, I departed at one o’clock in the
afternoon with my escort, and all my baggage,
in five open sledges. Each team consisted
of eight or ten dogs. I had taken a
man extraordinary to serve me as charioteer,
having no longer either strength or courage
to undertake the office: this fatiguing exercise
had wholly overcome me.</p>

<p>We soon came to the sea, upon which we
travelled in order to avoid seven mountains,
which rendered the common route extremely
difficult. We had scarcely advanced fifteen
wersts, partly upon the ice, and partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
upon the coast, when fortunately for us, we
were obliged to return, as the snow began
to fall, and the wind to blow with an impetuosity
that drove our dogs back, and made
our sledges totter. My guides delayed not
to inform me of the danger; and from the
fear of misleading us, they proposed that we
should take shelter in a deserted yourt that
was at no great distance, and the situation
of which they were perfectly acquainted
with.</p>

<p>It is upon a small river called <i>Yovanna</i>,
twenty wersts from Toumané. When we
came up to it we were covered with snow,
and almost frozen. We were all eager to
descend that we might be screened from the
tempest, but we found its entrance stopped
up with snow four feet deep. Having hastily
arranged our sledges, we took our
rackets, for want of shovels, and began to
open a passage. This work occupied us an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
hour. We were still in want of a ladder;
the most hardy ventured to leap down, and
the rest followed them. We fell upon the
carcasses of sea wolves entirely frozen, and
some of them half devoured, doubtless by
ravenous beasts, who, in the depth of winter,
had made this subterraneous habitation
their den. A leathern seine in one corner
of the yourt, was the only indication that
it had been visited by human beings. It is
to be presumed that the neighbouring Koriacs
had made use of it as a reservoir. The
walls were surrounded with icicles, which
fell down in chrystallizations; and in truth,
I can only compare this dwelling to a
large ice house. Its form was square, and
its dimensions about five feet deep by ten
large.</p>

<p>While we were employed in placing the
sea wolves out of the way, that we might
have more room to lie down, my conductors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
fastened our dogs<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, and gave them their
allowance of food; at the same time a fire
was kindled, and having warmed ourselves
and eaten our supper, I extended myself
upon the leathern net we had found in the
yourt. A sea wolf under my head served
me as a pillow. My companions imitated
my example; and, excepting the disadvantage
of having too confined a space, we
passed a very good night. We ceded an
entire corner to the Koriacs of my suite,
who huddled together, and were unable to
stretch themselves at their length; but they
made no complaint, and appeared not to be
conscious of any inconvenience. I saw them
squat down, like apes, their head muffled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
up in their parque, and their elbows
resting upon their knees; and in this posture
they slept as soundly as if wholly at
their ease.</p>

<p>The next day the wind changed, but its
violence did not abate, and it was the more
troublesome to us, as it drove the smoke
into the yourt to such a degree that we
were suffocated and blinded, and were obliged
not to light our fire except at our
meals.</p>

<p>I was desirous of remedying this inconvenience
by some external contrivances; but
I had no sooner placed my foot out of the
yourt than I was almost blown down. M.
Kisselioff, who accompanied me, had his
cap carried away, and was willing to pursue
it with some of our conductors; but it
was to no purpose; at the distance of fifteen
paces he entirely lost sight of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
retreat, and was only able to find his way
back by the cries we made in answer to
his.</p>

<p>We at last succeeded in placing a fence
sufficiently high to secure a free passage to
the smoke. From this moment we continued
our fire, without intermission, night
or day; but in spite of this care, we were
all chilled. The dampness became equally
insupportable with the cold. The fire gradually
melted the ice that surrounded us
and we had a thousand dribblings over our
heads, and a stream of water under our
feet. To increase our difficulties, the sea
wolves began to thaw, and diffuse a noxious
odour. That which exhaled from our bodies<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
was more than sufficient to make our
asylum a true sink. As it was impossible
to purify the air, we endeavoured at least to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
get rid of our neighbours, the sea wolves;
and my guides were the first to propose
that our dogs should be fed with them
while we continued in this frightful situation.
I consented the more readily, as the
scantiness of our dried fish obliged me to
consult œconomy. In thus appropriating
to myself what chance threw in our way, I
doubtless did an injury to some unfortunate
inhabitants of this quarter; but when reduced
to extremities, selfishness is sometimes
pardonable.</p>

<p>Impatient to pursue our journey, I sent
my Koriacs to observe the weather. In
two minutes I saw them descend perfectly
covered with snow, and so chilled, that they
could not open their mouths. Their report
corresponded with their sad appearance;
but of all their exclamations, I was
most struck with the account they gave me,
that the rocks, which were a few paces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
from our yourt, and very perceptible the
preceding evening, were now wholly invisible.</p>

<p>The 20, the weather becoming calmer,
and the snow having almost subsided, I
ordered preparations to be made for our
departure. Our dogs were therefore harnessed,
and we had hoisted ourselves out of
the yourt, when a terrible gust of wind deranged
all our measures. The snow came
on as thick as ever, and we were obliged to
retreat with precipitation, happy that we
were within reach of shelter. Almost instantly
I found myself ill. I know not
whether it were occasioned by passing suddenly
from cold to heat, or by the putrid
air I breathed in plunging myself into this
sink, or the vexation I felt at so many obstacles;
but I continued nearly a quarter of
an hour without sensation. The zeal of
my soldiers manifested itself on this occasion;
in order to restore me, one deluged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
me with water, while the other chafed my
temples so roughly with snow, that he rubbed
off, I believe, the skin.</p>

<p>My reflections, after this swoon, were as
melancholy as my situation. I considered
my plan as wholly defeated by these impediments
and delays, and was apprehensive
of not arriving at Okotsk till the rivers
were broken up. In the mean time this
was indispensible, if I intended to make use
of the mode of sledge travelling, to reach
the place called the Cross of Yudoma, or
<i>Yudomskoi-krest</i>. Hence I had designed to
proceed to Yakotsk by a circuitous passage
down the rivers Yudoma, Maya, and Aldann<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>,
by which means I found that I should
escape the inconveniencies of the thaw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
which renders the road impracticable even
to horses. But according to the calculation
I had made, the hindrance of a single day
might occasion me a delay of more than
two months. It is necessary to have been
in my place, to judge how very discouraging
was my prospect; the dangers that beset
me appeared in my eyes to be less terrible.</p>

<p>At length, the 21, it was possible to proceed.
The sky was still covered with clouds,
and the snow fell heavily, but the wind had
ceased, and we resolved to set off in spite of
our apprehension of another hurricane,
which would exceedingly have distressed
us, as we had no hope of refuge till we
came to Yamsk. We directed our course
towards the sea, upon which we constantly
travelled at the distance of two wersts from
the shore; but in the evening we thought it
prudent to approach nearer, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
halt. The ice was perfectly smooth, and
our little camp was easily erected.</p>

<p>The next morning we rose tolerably
early, and in order to avoid the curvatures
of the shore, we made for the main ocean.
We had observed some bays the preceding
evening, but they were less extensive than
one which we crossed in the afternoon of
this day. Unfortunately, when we were
opposite to it, a gust of wind prevented us
from examining it.</p>

<p>I understood, from my guides, that it was
called from the river Iret, which falls into
it, that it is almost entirely closed, and is
dry in summer, when the sea is low. In
spring it abounds with water fowl. The
inhabitants of Yamsk and its environs catch
them with nets, and hunt them with sticks
in the moulting season. The shallowness
of the bay, which is in all places fordable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
is favourable to the diversion of these sportsmen.</p>

<p>Upon the approach of night we came on
shore, and halted till the morning in a
wood of firs, upon the banks of the river
Iret.</p>

<p>The 23 furnished nothing remarkable.
The wind assailed us with considerable violence
in the middle of a plain, the extent
of which was twenty five wersts. I had
again recourse to my compass, and we had
not proceeded fifteen wersts, when the sky
suddenly cleared up. We met a sergeant
with dispatches from Okotsk; and a little
farther, about three wersts from its mouth,
the river Yamsk presented itself. We pursued
its course, and passed at the right an
habitation of fishermen, resorted to only in
summer. Six wersts farther we came to the
ostrog of Yamsk, which is more than a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and fifty from Toumané. My biscuits
were nearly consumed, and I was constrained
not only to sleep there, but to remain a
considerable part of the next day, to supply
myself with a fresh stock of provisions.</p>

<p>The serjeant who commanded the garrison,
which was composed of twenty men,
received me with civility. Upon the recommendation
of the governor of Ingiga,
he assiduously provided every thing of which
I stood in need, and gave me the necessary
information.</p>

<p>The ostrog, or fort of Yamsk, is upon the
border of the river, ten wersts from its
mouth, where it forms a bay that seems to
promise excellent anchorage; but a variety
of capes advancing a considerable way, and
a great number of shoals with which the
entrance is as it were blocked up, render it
the more dangerous, as the passage is narrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and obliges the ships frequently to
beat about, or lie to for a favourable wind,
in order to pass over them, for it is almost
impossible to succeed with a side wind.
From this account it is evident, that if the
place were more considerable and more
frequented, shipwrecks would be more common<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>There are at Yamsk only twenty five
houses, built of wood; a part of which,
where the church<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> is situated, is surrounded
with a square enclosure of pallisades,
like that of Ingiga, but not so high or so
thick. The inhabitants amount to twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
families, whose mode of life is similar to
that of the Russians.</p>

<p>They have a method of making salt, that
was new to me. The wood which the sea
throws now and then upon the shore, is
collected with the greatest care. When
it is dry, they burn it; the ashes are afterwards
boiled, and the sediment which it
leaves is a very white salt.</p>

<p>Two days previous to my arrival at Yamsk,
a troop of wandering Toungouses had left
this settlement. To console me under the
disappointment of having missed them, I
was favoured with a sight of the full dress,
both of the men and women. They wear
no chemises, but a kind of stomacher fastened
behind, and which descends to the
knees like an apron. It is embroidered
with the hair of rein deer, and ornamented
with glass beads of various colours, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
are added at the bottom plates of iron and
copper, and a considerable number of small
bells. Under this apron they wear a sort
of breeches, or pantaloon, made of skin,
and their legs are covered with long boots,
which have the hair on the outside, and are
embroidered. A long waistcoat covers their
shoulders, to the extremities of the sleeves
of which gloves are fastened, with an opening
under the wrist for the sake of pulling
them off more conveniently. This waistcoat,
close at the breast, and fitted to the
shape, terminates near the middle of the
thigh, and is also ornamented with embroidery
and beads. From the small of
the back hangs a tail, two feet long, but
not very large. It is made of the hair of
sea wolves, died of different colours. The
head dress is a small round cap, which
widens a little on each side to cover the ears.
The whole attire is made of the skin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
young deer, and trimmed with sables, otters,
or other furs of equal value.</p>

<p>The garb of the women is nearly the
same, except that it has no tail or gloves,
and that there is a small opening in the
crown of their caps of about two inches in
diameter, which is doubtless made for the
purpose of passing the hair through.</p>

<p>Such is the mode of these people. In
winter they wear thick fur clothing; but
they are careful, for fear of injuring it, to
change their dress the moment they enter
their yourts, and to put on their worst garments;
and upon the most trivial occasions
they strip themselves entirely naked.</p>

<p>We felt this day the force of the sun,
which announced an approaching thaw. Of
consequence I furnished myself with plates of
whale-bone to be fastened under the skates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of my sledges, in case of necessity; and by
the advice of the people of the country,
founded on the experience of travellers in
this season of the year, I resolved to travel
in the night, and to rest in the day, when
the sun had most power. I came out of
Yamsk at eleven o’clock in the evening,
our caravan consisting of nine large sledges,
or <i>nartas</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>At break of day we found ourselves at
the foot of a mountain, fifty wersts from
Yamsk. The Koriacs have given it the
name of <i>Babouschka</i>, or <i>grandmother</i>. The
summit, they say, is the tomb of an old
sorceress, equally renowned and formidable.
My guides maintained that it was the
loftiest mountain in this part of the world;
but their superstitious fears seem to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
magnified it, as, in my opinion, that of
Villegui is much steeper, at least I found
more difficulty in ascending it. Arrived at
the top of the Babouschka, they placed iron
cramps under their feet, in the form of
small tripods, and fastened, transversely under
the sledges, tolerably large sticks, in
order to impede the velocity in descending.
No farther care was necessary than that of
guiding them with the <i>oschtol</i>, or stick pointed
with iron, and we came to the bottom
without any accident. The inhabitants of
the country however consider this descent
as dangerous, particularly when the inequalities
are filled up with snow, which in
that case become so many concealed and
inevitable gulphs, and, I am inclined to believe,
frequently prove fatal to travellers.</p>

<p>In all probability, the dread which the
Koriacs entertain of this Babouschka originated
in the following manner. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
natural effect of their prejudice, they feel
disposed to acts of gratitude the moment
they find themselves out of danger. The
Koriacs who attended me were eager to
hang up their offering, which consisted of
small quantities of tobacco, scraps of fish,
pieces of iron, &amp;c. upon the summit where
they suppose the sorceress to sleep. Others
had left there before them old cramps of
iron, knives, arrows, and broken arms. I perceived
a Tchouktchi javelin ornamented with
ivory, and I advanced to seize it with a view
of keeping it, but the cry of my conductors
stopped me. “What would you do?”
said one of them. “Are you desirous of
ruining us? Such a sacrilege would
draw down upon us the most dreadful
calamities, and you would be unable to
pursue your journey.” At this apostrophe
I could have laughed in the face of the
timid prophet, if I had not stood in need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of the succour of these people. To continue
to merit it, it was necessary to respect
their error, and I assumed therefore a
becoming gravity; but no sooner had they
turned their backs, than I laid hold of this
terrible arrow, as a monument of their absurd
credulity.</p>

<p>The first village I came to was Srednoi
There is something picturesque in its situation,
which is upon the border of the sea,
at the entrance of a deep bay that loses itself
in the land, by forming the channel of
a small river, the water of which is always
free from any brackish taste. The Koriacs,
who inhabit it, received me with cordiality.
I rested myself for a few hours in one of
the two yourts, which, with a number of
magazines, constitute the whole ostrog. The
yourts are constructed like those of the fixed
Koriacs, with this difference, that they are
not subterraneous, and that the entrance is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
by a door upon a level with the ground.
Muscles abound on these coasts, and are the
principal food of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>I came away in the evening with fresh
dogs, and travelled eight wersts upon the
river Srednoi. The ice, in various places,
broke under our sledges, but the hardiness
and skill of my guides extricated us from
the difficulty. Obliged to go on shore to
free the vehicles, they had the precaution to
put on their rackets, that they might have a
more extensive footing on the ice. But the
greatest inconvenience in travelling on this
river was occasioned by the slipperiness of the
ice; our dogs were unable to support themselves,
and fell down every moment one
upon another.</p>

<p>Before noon of the 26, we reached the
ostrog of Siglann, the last in the Koriac territories,
which is upon a river of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
name. It is seventy seven wersts from the
preceding, and is neither larger nor more
populous. It contains only one yourt, built
like those of the Yakoutes, the description
of which I shall defer till my arrival with
these people. I stayed at Siglann to arrange
the skates of our sledges, that is, to fasten
plates of whale-bone under them, which
the melting of the snow rendered necessary,
and I departed at five o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p>I first crossed a bay, called by the name of
the village. It was large, and appeared to
be well defended, except at the south and
south east. The whole coast is of considerable
height, and the bay extends so far, that
I was eight hours in gaining the western
cape. Farther on I found another curvature
not less considerable, called the <i>Bay of
Ola</i>. In spite of the velocity of our pace,
we were ten hours in passing over the widest
part of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>The 27, about three o’clock in the afternoon
I stopt at Ola, a Toungouse ostrog, a
hundred and fourteen wersts from Siglann.
It is situated upon a sandy flat at the mouth
of the river Ola, which, widening at this
place, affords a small harbour, to the extremity
of which the Toungouses retire in the
severe weather. They had quitted it two
days before, and had taken possession of the
ten yourts that make up the village, and in
which they reside as long as the warm weather
lasts.</p>

<p>These yourts are not formed underground,
like those of the Kamtschadales and
the majority of the fixed Koriacs; they are
also longer and of a superior construction.
The walls are supported by thick posts, and
there is a narrow opening at the top of the
roof, that extends from one end to the
other; the fire place is in like manner of
the same length as the house. Eight feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
above the fire, which is kept in during the
whole summer, they hang upon cross beams
their stock of fish and sea wolves, in order
to dry and smoke them, and this indeed is
the chief advantage of these buildings. By
means of two doors in opposite sides of the
yourt, they are able to introduce whole
trees and enormous pieces of wood, with
which the fire is supplied. Each family
have their bed in little distinct huts in the
sides of the building. The yourt I entered
was divided into apartments, the walls of
which consisted merely of prepared fish
skins, sewn together, and stained with different
colours. This singular tapestry has
by no means a disagreeable appearance.</p>

<p>The winter yourts are round, and built
upon the ground like the summer ones.
The walls are constructed of large beams,
placed perpendicularly, and the covering
is inclined like the roofs among us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
with a hole in the top for the evaporation
of the smoke. They have a door, the bottom
of which is upon a level with the foundation.
Some of them have within a kind
of corridor, which breaks the column of
air, so that the smoke issues more freely.</p>

<p>The instant of my arrival at Ola, I was
visited by a number of women, some dressed
in the Russian, and others in the Toungouse
mode. Expressing my surprise at
seeing them so fine, I was informed that it
was the village feast; it was also, I understood,
a part of their coquetry to appear in
their best attire before strangers. Of their
most esteemed ornaments, embroideries of
glass beads seem to have the preference. Some
of them are wrought with tolerable taste;
among others, I observed one on the boot
of a young girl that had an admirable air
of lightness; it concealed in no respect the
beauty of the leg, that was covered with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
kind of pantaloon of skin, nicely fitted, over
which hung a small petticoat.</p>

<p>There is a striking resemblance between
the Russians and Toungouses; they have
similar features and the same language.
The men are strong and well made; some
of the women have an Asiatic appearance,
but not the flat nose and broad face of the
Kamtschadales and the majority of the Koriacs.
Mildness and hospitality seem to be
characteristic qualities of these people. It
was not from a defect of zeal, on their part,
that I did not procure the succour I wanted;
but their ability was so small, that they
could only change a part of my dogs.</p>

<p>Upon leaving this village we proceeded
on the sea. The ice embarassed us considerably
in the course of the night, and the
frequent cracks which we heard under us,
were not calculated to dispel our fears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>At break of day we reached the main
land, in order to surmount a steep promontory.
Our way was so complicated,
that we had allowed ourselves seven hours
to gain the sea again, but the descent was
more difficult than had been represented,
and it was necessary to make ourselves a
passage through a wood of birch trees.
One of my guides, suffering himself to descend
like the rest, by the mere force of the
slope, from the top of the mountain to the
bottom, was overturned by the shock of a
sledge, which struck against him just as he
was turning an angle. He endeavoured to
lay hold of the trunk of a tree, and unfortunately
fell upon the pointed end of his
stick, which entered his side; he had also
received a violent blow in the head, and we
were obliged to place him on one of our
baggage sledges.</p>

<p>At the foot of the mountain we had another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
perplexity, occasioned by the sea being
broken up. How great had been our risk
during the night! My conductors were
terrified at it equally with myself. “What
will become of us,” cried they? “It is
now that we have the most alarming
dangers to encounter.” Dissembling my
uneasiness, I attempted to encourage them.
We continued our course for some time
along the shore; a melancholy silence prevailed
among my people, whose countenances
were expressive of consternation.</p>

<p>In about half an hour the person at the
head of the file suddenly stopped, exclaiming
that it was not possible to proceed any
farther. I conceived at first that his terror
magnified the difficulties, and I sent my
soldier Golikoff with one of the most experienced
of my guides to examine our situation.
They quickly came back, and confirmed
the ill tidings. Golikoff advised that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
we should return, and endeavour to find a
way by land, but my guides rejected his
counsel, declaring that it was nearly impossible
to ascend, on this side, the mountain
we had just passed, and that even if we succeeded,
the route would be too considerable,
and also too dangerous on account of the
rapidity of the thaw, and their little acquaintance
with the country. They concluded
by proposing to us to abandon our
sledges, to select the most valuable part of
my property, and to cross the bay by leaping
from one sheet of ice to another. But
the current began to put them in motion,
and the sea was covered with isolated pieces;
it may be supposed therefore that I felt no
great inclination to adopt this mode of travelling,
to which however the people of the
country are frequently reduced. I knew
not what plan to follow; at length I resolved
to try myself if I could not find some
practicable path along the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>A chain of rocks, which, through its
whole extent, presents to the sea a flat perpendicular
surface, and consequently without
the least appearance of strand, was the
description of the shore I visited. The sea,
in carrying off the mountains of ice which
had concealed its surface, had left a horizontal
crust suspended to the side of this enormous
wall, which was not more than two
feet wide, frequently not more than one,
and scarcely one foot in thickness. Eight
feet below this sort of cornice, you saw the
waves beating against the rock, and innumerable
shelves that the eye discovered in
the sea, and that seemed about ten feet below
its surface.</p>

<p>I did not suffer these observations to discourage
me, but immediately committed
myself to this perilous cornice. Emboldened
by its solidity, I advanced softly in a
sidelong direction, my face turned towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the rock. It offered no hold to the hands,
but only now and then a narrow cavity,
into which I threw myself to recover breath;
after having passed the gaps of the crust,
which continually presented themselves to
my steps, the ice being in certain places
completely washed away, and a breach
left of two or three feet in length. At
first I must confess I felt myself intimidated,
and did not leap them without trembling:
the least error in position, the most trifling
accident would have destroyed me. My
companions could not have relieved, nor
even so much as have seen me. This progress
continued for three quarters of an
hour, at the end of which I reached the
other extremity of the rock, and no sooner
had I arrived than I forgot the dangers of
the way to think only of my dispatches. I
had left them under the care of my soldiers,
but I alone could undertake to save them.
The experiment I had made encouraged me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
and proud of my discovery, I did not hesitate
to return upon my steps.</p>

<p>My people condemned my conduct, which
they considered as rashness, and expressed
their astonishment at seeing me again. I
concealed not from them that the way was
hazardous; “but as no accident had happened to me,
why, I asked, should you be
deterred from following me? I will once
more make the attempt, and I hope upon
my return to find you free from apprehension,
and disposed to imitate my example.”</p>

<p>I immediately took up my port-folio,
and the box that contained my dispatches.
My two soldiers Golikoff, and Nedarezoff,
whose dexterity I had already experienced,
consented to accompany me. Without their
assistance it would, I believe, have been impossible
to save this precious deposit; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
carried it in turn, exchanging it from one
to another. He that had last received it,
for instance, who always marched foremost
upon this narrow parapet, threw it suddenly
into a hollow place of the rock, advancing
at the same time a few steps; the
others came after him, took up his burthen,
and relieved themselves from it by the same
manœuvre. I cannot express what I felt
during this operation; at every stride of the
bearer over the gaps of the path, I imagined
I saw my box ready to fall into the sea.
Twenty times it was upon the point of escaping
from our hands, and I felt my very
blood curdle as if I had seen death itself
gaping under my steps. Indeed I am not
able to say what would have been the effect
of my despair, if I had had the misfortune to
lose it. I knew not a moment’s ease till I had
deposited this solemn charge in a place of
safety; my joy was then as vehement as had
been my anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>This second success inspired me with so
much confidence, that I no longer doubted
of the possibility of transporting our sledges
in the same manner. I communicated my
ideas to my soldiers: animated by my example,
and by the event of their first experiment,
they cheerfully returned with me
for this new undertaking. By my order
they had unharnessed a part of the dogs;
they now fastened to the four corners of the
sledges long thongs of leather which I directed
to be held by those who were before
and behind the vehicle. We presently found
the utility of this precaution; our sledges
were sometimes wider than the parapet, and
of consequence only rested on one skate, so
that the load must have overturned them
into the water if they had not been strongly
supported; at other times the ice, as I have
said, was entirely gone, when it was necessary
to give them a sudden elevation in order
to preserve their equilibrium. The muscular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
arms of my guides were scarcely equal
to the weight, and it was sometimes as much
as all of us could do to keep one another
from falling. It was to no purpose, for us
to grapple the rock; it was perpetually to
be feared that one of us should draw in the
other, or that the ice should suddenly fail
under our feet. We however suffered nothing
but the apprehension.</p>

<p>We returned once more to fetch the rest
of our dogs. It seemed as if these poor
animals judged better than ourselves of the
extent of the danger, so much did they
bark and draw back, particularly at the difficult
passages. It was to no purpose to
cheer them with our voice, it was necessary
to strike them, or to pull them rapidly after
us. There were four of them, who from
aukwardness or terror, could not leap like
the rest. The first perished in our sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
without the possibility of our assisting him<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>,
the second remained suspended by his fore
feet; one of my guides, supported by his
comrade and leaning forward, was fortunate
enough to save him; the other two were
supported by their traces, and were easily
extricated from the peril.</p>

<p>These various crossings backward and
forward occasioned us seven hours incessant
labour and apprehension. We were no
sooner out of danger than we returned
thanks to heaven like so many persons escaped
from death. We embraced one another
with transport, as if each had owed to
his companion the preservation of his life.
In short, our happiness was better felt than
it is in my power to describe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>
<p>We made all possible haste to remedy
the disorder of our equipage, and immediately
proceeded on a flinty strand, the
breadth and solidity of which relieved us
from all disquietude. In about two hours,
at a little distance from the ostrog of Armani,
we met a number of sledges returning
empty to Ola, and which of course could
have no other way than that which we had
just passed. We informed the conductors
of the difficulty, and wished them equal
success.</p>

<p>The village of Armani is eighty wersts
from Ola. It consists merely of two yourts,
a summer and a winter one, situated by a
river of the same name. We passed on
to the house of a Yakout, three hundred
paces farther, where, it was said, I should
find a better lodging. It was a yourt in
the middle of a large wood of fir trees, and
had been inhabited by him thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>In his absence his wife received me with
the utmost cordiality. She offered us milk,
and a sourish beverage made chiefly of
mare’s milk, called <i>koumouiss</i>. Its taste was
by no means disagreeable; and my Russians,
in spite of their superstitious aversion for
every kind of food that comes from the
horse, highly relished it. The husband arrived
while this was passing, who was a venerable
old man, but as yet full of health
and vigour. Informed of the object of my
journey by his wife, and my soldier Golikoff,
who, being a native of Yakoutsk,
served as interpreter, my host instantly
cleaned the most distinguished place in the
room that I might repose myself. I was
awaked by the lowings of the herd
which came into the yourt. Eight cows,
a bull, and a number of calves, divided the
apartment with me. Notwithstanding this
company, there was an appearance of cleanliness,
and the air was sweet and wholesome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
This Yakout does not pass his time like the
Koriacs and Kamtschadales, in catching and
preparing fish, a species of food upon which
he sets little value; hunting, and the care
of his cattle, occupy his whole attention,
and supply all his wants. Besides his herd,
he has also ten horses, which he uses for
various purposes, and which are kept in an
inclosure at a little distance from the yourt.
Every thing about this habitation has an air
of ease, and creates in the spectator tranquil
and cheerful feelings. I know not
whether the sight of the herd, the appearance
of plenty, or the excellence of the milk
provisions communicated some charm to our
repast, but I conceived it to be the most
sumptuous I had made for a considerable
time. The master of the house had the
kindness before my departure to add some
game to my stock of provisions.</p>

<p>We separated the same evening mutually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
satisfied with each other. I travelled the
whole night, and arrived in the morning at
the fort of Taousk, being a distance of
forty-two wersts. This ostrog, where, in
conformity to the plan we had laid down,
we spent the day, is situated on the river
Taon. It contains twenty isbas, a small
church served by the vicar of Okotsk, and
a building for the reception of tributes,
surrounded by palisades in the form of bastions.
Twenty Yakouts, two chiefs, and
some other Koriacs, who, attracted by the
situation, have settled there, make up the
whole of the inhabitants. The garrison
consists of fifteen soldiers, commanded by a
serjeant named Okhotin, at whose house I
took up my abode till the evening.</p>

<p>In the night I passed through the village
of Gorbé, peopled by Yakouts, and a small
number of Koriacs. At break of day we
lost sight of the sea. We had for some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
journeyed upon the banks of the Taon,
and gradually we advanced farther into the
land. During 1 and 2 May, we travelled
through fields, and upon the river Kava,
without perceiving a single habitation.</p>

<p>The 3, at the very instant when we were
about to halt in the middle of a wood of
fir trees, a gale of wind rose, accompanied
with a heavy snow. My tent, suspended over
the sledges containing our baggage, served
us for a shelter. But it was necessary to
have a fire. My conductors, who undertook
to procure wood, were buried as high as
their waists in snow, and even with their
rackets they sunk up to their knees. In the
afternoon the wind changed, and the sky
became clear. We immediately mounted
our sledges, but the depth of the snow obliged
us to alight in turns to open a passage
for the dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning of 4 May, we passed over
the mountain of Iné, two hundred and
twenty wersts from Taousk. It may be compared
in height to that of Babouschka.
When at the summit, the cold pierced us to
such a degree that we stopped to kindle a
fire. In about five hours we came again to
the sea, which we left at a short distance
from the village of Iné, where we arrived in
the dusk of the evening.</p>

<p>This ostrog is thirty wersts from the
mountain, and is peopled by Russians and
Yakouts, whose habitations are isbas and
yourts. They have the care of a stud of
two hundred horses, which we had an opportunity
of seeing, ten wersts from the
village. I intended to have changed my
team, and sat off again immediately, but I
was detained by the difficulty of procuring
dogs. The chief of the place was dead
drunk, and it was not till after an hou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>r’s
importunity and search that we were able
to procure an adequate supply.</p>

<p>Twenty-five wersts from Iné, where, that
I might make the greater speed, I had left
my equipage under the care of my faithful
Golikoff, with orders to follow me as quickly
as possible, I passed two yourts inhabited
by Yakouts and Toungouses. The name
of this hamlet is Oulbé. Farther on I met
a number of convoys with flour, which was
to be distributed in the neighbouring villages,
and made into biscuits to supply the
ships of M. Billings, of whom I shall presently
have occasion to speak.</p>

<p>We came again upon the coast, and I
travelled forty-seven wersts without quitting
it, during which time I saw a number of
sea wolves, and a whale driven upon the
shore. At the top of the mountain called
Marikann, that is at the distance of twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
wersts, I had the pleasure to discover
the town of Okotsk, but I was attacked by
a gale of wind that made me apprehensive
of a new delay. Regardless of every thing
but my impatience, I continued my route,
resolving to brave all accidents. My courage
however was not put to the test;
before we reached the shore the weather
was calm, and I was able to satisfy my
curiosity by examining the wreck of a
vessel that was driven on the coast. Having
crossed, with trepidation, the river Okhota<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>,
I entered Okotsk 5 May, at four
o’clock in the afternoon, accompanied only
by Nedarezoff.</p>

<p>I alighted at the house of major Kokh,
vested with the command in the absence of
M. Kasloff, whose arrival with me he had long
expected. The governor’s letter informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
him of the cause of our separation, and I
gave him a brief account of the melancholy
circumstances attending it. I hastened to
pay my compliments to Madame Kasloff,
and deliver the packets entrusted to my care,
but she was in the country four wersts from
Okotsk, and I was so fatigued that M. Kokh
would not permit me to wait upon her that
day. An express was sent off with the letters,
and my apologies, and I fixed on the
next day for my visit. Presuming that I
principally stood in need of repose, the major
obligingly conducted me to the apartment
destined for me in the house of M. Kasloff.
I found every convenience of which I had
been deprived ever since my departure from
Ingiga. In the space of three hundred and
fifty leagues I had not, except once at
Yamsk, slept in a bed.</p>

<p>As soon as I rose in the morning I was
visited by M. Kokh, and the principal officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and merchants of the town. M. Allegretti,
surgeon to the expedition of M.
Billings, was among them. From the facility
with which he spoke the French language,
I should have taken him for a countryman,
if he had not, upon introducing
himself, informed that he was an Italian.
My meeting with him was the more fortunate,
as the pain in my breast had returned.
I hesitated not to consult him, and am happy
in having an opportunity to declare,
that to his skill, and the care he bestowed
upon me during my stay, I am indebted
for the perfect cure of my complaint.</p>

<p>M. Kokh conducted me to his house to
dinner, where I had an opportunity of becoming
better acquainted with him<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
kindness extended so far as to form a
thousand plans of amusement, which he
was eager to communicate with the hope
of inducing me to make some stay with
him.</p>

<p>If my duty had not prohibited every voluntary
delay, I could not easily have resisted
the urgency of his invitations, and the
fascinating pleasure of his society; but faithful
to my trust, it was necessary to sacrifice
my inclinations and my repose to the rapidity
of my journey. I convinced my host
of this, and yielding to my reasons, he became
satisfied with my eagerness to quit
him, and even seconded my zeal by assiduously
providing the means for my departure.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>
<p>The rain had been incessant since my arrival,
and the people who were sent out to
examine the roads, conceived them to be
impassable, at least with dogs. From their
report, the daily increase of the thaw deprived
me of all hope of advancing farther,
unless by means of rein deer, and M. Kokh
therefore sent an express to a horde of wandering
Toungouses that had left Okotsk a
few days before, to procure me a supply
of these animals.</p>

<p>Having taken these measures, the major
accompanied me to Boulguin, the country
house of Madame Kasloff, who received me as
the friend of her husband, and the companion
of his dangers. The object of her affections
was the subject of our whole conversation.
She demanded an account of all
our difficulties at the period of our separation.
It was in vain that I attempted to
soften in my description such circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
as were calculated to impress themselves too
forcibly; her sensibility told her that it was
from an unwillingness to give her pain, and
it only alarmed her the more. I did not
well know how to console her, for I was
not myself without anxiety respecting this
valuable man; but assisted by M. Kokh,
I assumed with tolerable success an air of
serenity. I had recourse to conjectures;
and the major, on his part, mentioned
a variety of consoling expedients; and at
last we restored tranquillity to the mind of
this affectionate wife, by flattering her with
the speedy arrival of M. Kasloff. This
lady was born at Okotsk, and appeared to
have had the best education; she spoke the
French language with elegance. In the solitude
of her retreat, her chief happiness
was placed in educating a daughter about
three years old, the express image of her
father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>Having made all my visits to the officers
of the garrison, I returned to Boulguin to
dine with Mrs. Kasloff, as I had promised,
when she gave me letters to her relations
at Moscow.</p>

<p>The next day our express arrived, but he
had not been able to overtake the Toungouses,
who had separated, and were dispersed
through the country. Here ended
of course our hope of rein deer. Meanwhile
it seemed necessary that I should not defer
my departure, as the roads became worse
every day. The longer I wait, said I to
myself, the less capable shall I be of reaching
the cross of Yudoma before the rivers
are entirely broken up, and the greater will
be the risk of my being stopped by the
floods. Filled with these reflections, I renewed
my entreaties that M. Kokh would
allow me to proceed. It was in vain he alledged
the many disagreeable circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
I should experience, the obstacles I should
encounter, the dangers to which I should
be exposed, from the season being too far
advanced to travel with sledges; I persisted
in my resolution. At last he complied, and
promised to give the necessary orders, that
nothing might prevent my setting off the
next day, upon condition that I would return
the moment I found myself in any
imminent danger. I was glad to obtain my
liberty, and consented to all that he proposed.
I spent the remainder of the day in
walking about the town in order to give a
description of it, accompanied by a number
of persons who were able to assist my enquiries.</p>

<p>Longer than it is wide, the town of Okotsk
extends nearly in a direct line from east to
west; the sea is at the south within a hundred
yards of the houses, and the interval
between consists of a flinty strand; at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
north the walls are washed by the Okhota;
to the east is the mouth of this river, that
is, at the extremity of a neck of land upon
which the town is built, and that extends
from thence to the west. The town has
nothing in it extraordinary; the structure
of the houses has little variety, as they are
only isbas, a few of which, situated to the
east, are larger and more commodious than
the rest, and are destined for the use of the
officers. M. Kokh lives at the other end
of the town; the gate of his court yard
opens into the high street, the regularity
of which is broken by a square, in which
are the house of the governor, and the sessions-house,
both of them under the same
roof. Opposite to them is the guard-house,
and on the left side of the square the parish
church. These buildings have no very
splendid appearance. They were formerly
enclosed with palisades, of which there are
still some vestiges. The remains of a gate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
to the west of the government house, shews
that this was what they called a fortress.
Behind it is a street reaching almost to the
river, inhabited by tradesmen, whose shops,
regularly arranged, line each side of the
street.</p>

<p>The port is so very insignificant, that I
could not have called it by this name, if I
had not counted in it seven or eight vessels
or galliots, some of them belonging to the
crown, and others to merchants, who carry
on a fur trade with America. The port is
to the east, almost at the extremity of the
town, and near the river, by a kind of appendage
to which it is formed. Upon the
invitation of M. Hall, lieutenant in the
navy, I accompanied him to the dock to see
two small ships that were building for the
voyage of discovery intrusted to M. Billings.
The sailors, soldiers, and carpenters,
had been sent out at a very considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
expence; and the armament, which
goes on rapidly, must cost the empress an
immense sum.</p>

<p>Faithful to his promise, M. Kokh had
made all the preparations for my departure,
and 10 May in the evening, my
sledges being loaded and harnessed, I took
leave of him and the rest of the officers,
who expressed their desire of seeing me
return.</p>

<p>My company was augmented by two
men, who were to serve me as pilots on the
river Yudoma. I travelled all night, notwithstanding
the wretched state of the
roads, which corresponded with the report
that had been made. They were completely
covered with water, and in some
places, the woods in particular, it reached
to the bellies of our dogs. The wind continued
south, the sky became more clouded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
and every thing indicated that the thaw was
not likely to cease.</p>

<p>In the mean time, having crossed the
river Okhota, I arrived without accident
to the village of Medvejé-golova, or <i>bear’s-head</i>,
which is forty-five wersts from Okotsk,
and is inhabited by Russians and Yakouts.
I entered very early in the morning, but
our dogs were so weary that I was obliged
to spend the day and even the night there,
being unable to procure a fresh supply.</p>

<p>I had hoped to be at Moundoukan the
next day, which is twenty wersts from the
preceding ostrog. Half way a part of our
dogs refused to draw, and we reluctantly
ventured upon a river that seemed to offer
us a more commodious way. We had
scarcely advanced a few paces, when we
heard a sudden crack under our sledges;
the next moment I felt myself gently sink,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
but a piece of ice still kept me up. It
broke a second time, and my skates became
almost invisible. Every effort to extricate
myself would have been fruitless, as the
least motion must have carried me forward
and plunged me into the water. Fortunately
it was only four feet deep; by their
exertions, my people at last drew me from
my embarassment, but they were nearly
as much in want of assistance themselves.
Deaf to the remonstrances of my conductors,
I was desirous of proceeding, but
we soon found it necessary mutually to aid
each other in gaining the bank. Meanwhile
the snow melted so rapidly, that our
dogs paddled in the water without advancing
a step, and fell one upon another exhausted
with fatigue.</p>

<p>Among my guides was a serjeant, whom
M. Kokh had given me for my better security.
His reputation for courage and
experience led me to consider him as my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
compass and guardian, and I kept my eye
fixed upon him, observing his motions and
studying his countenance, which had hitherto
been inflexibly composed. In the
midst of the murmurs of the rest of my
company, he had not uttered a word nor
altered a muscle of his face, so as to discover
any emotion. I naturally construed this
silence into a disavowal of the fears with
which they attempted to fill me, and his
tranquillity as an encouragement to go on.
Never had my astonishment been greater
than to see him suddenly stop, protesting
that he would not proceed a step farther. I
interrogated him, and urged him to explain
himself. “I can no longer be silent,” he
answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a><br /><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> “influenced by a sentiment of
vanity, and a desire to display superior
courage, I have hitherto withheld from
giving my opinion respecting the hazardous
measure you are desirous of pursuing;
but the more I admire your intrepidity,
the more I think myself bound to
prevent the fatal consequences it may occasion,
and to inform you of the many
dangers and obstacles that will every instant
spring up before you. The majority
of the rivers are already disencumbered
of their ice, and could you so far
succeed as to pass them, you would soon
be overtaken and surrounded by the
floods. What will then be your resource?
To seek an asylum on a mountain or in a
forest, if you should be fortunate enough
to meet with one. Like the inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
of these cantons in such circumstances, can
you build yourself a cabin on the tops
of the trees, there to remain a fortnight
or three weeks till the waters shall subside?
And are you sure that even in this
lofty retreat they will not reach you, or
force you down, together with the tree
that serves as your support? Are you sure
that your stock of provisions will preserve
you, during this interval, from the apprehensions
of famine? If this summary view
of the calamities that await you are not
sufficient to intimidate you, proceed; you
are your own master; I have done my
duty, and must beg leave to quit you.”</p>

<p>This blunt remonstrance, and the terrible
prediction it contained, did not fail to
make a strong impression on my mind, and
I considered that I could not do better than
return immediately to Okotsk, from which
we were only fifty-five wersts distant.</p>

<p>We reached Medvejé-golova the same
evening, where I stayed till four o’clock in
the afternoon of the next day. From
thence to the river Okhota I felt no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
inconvenience than that of travelling very
slowly, but to compensate for this short respite,
we experienced, when we came to
cross the river, new perils and new alarms.
I confess that I was equally terrified with
my people, and dared neither measure with
my eye the width of the river, nor lose
sight for a moment of the trace of my
sledge. The instability of the ice, which
was moved up and down by the current,
made me apprehensive that it could not
bear the weight of so many passengers, and
I expected every instant that an abyss would
open and swallow up some of us. At
length having gained the bank, we counted
over the company one after another, to
convince ourselves that no one was lost,
and the pleasure of having escaped this
tremendous danger, gave wings to the remainder
of our journey to Okotsk, where
we arrived the 14 at noon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>So speedy a return, occasioned some
pleasantries on the part of M. Kokh and
the other officers; each reminded me of his
prediction; but I was less confused at the
folly of my attempt, than mortified and
distressed at its failure. I calculated with
grief that my stay in this town would not
perhaps be less than a month. Engrossed
by a thousand melancholy ideas, I was for
some time incapable of returning any answer
to the demonstrations of joy and friendship
which were heaped upon me. All the obstacles
I had met with from my first landing
at the port of Saint Peter and Saint Paul,
occurred at once to my mind, and I conceived
that the invincible hand of fate opposed
itself to the success of my embassy.
It was to no purpose that I employed every
means of being expeditious; it was to no
purpose that I had pushed my zeal to rashness,
and on many occasions hazarded both
my life and my dispatches. What a distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
was I still from Petersburg! In the
mean time six months are frequently known
to be sufficient for this journey; and a vessel
leaving Bolcheretsk in July, will, if it meet
with no accident, commonly arrive at Okotsk
in three weeks or a month, and sometimes
in twelve or fifteen days. From Okotsk to
Yakoutsk, on horseback, is only the business
of a month, and in like manner from
Yakoutsk to Irkoutsk, whether we sail down,
the Lena, or ride along its banks. At
Irkoutsk it will probably be necessary to
wait six weeks till the frost sets in, and by
means of sledges it is easy travelling to
Petersburg in a similar portion of time; the
governor general has performed it in twenty
eight days.</p>

<p>It is impossible to express my impatience
and despair, when I contrasted the tediousness
of my journey with this expeditious
mode of travelling. Eight months had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
already elapsed, and I was no farther than
Okotsk. It is true, I had no choice of season,
and had been detained nearly three months
at Bolcheretsk; obliged beside to make by
land the tour of the peninsula of Kamtschatka,
I had had to contend with tempests
and a thousand obstacles, each more grievous
than the preceding. These delays had been
equally involuntary and unavoidable; and
though they may be pleaded in my justification,
they do not remove the regret
that is inseparable from the recollection of
them. It is always distressing not to be
able to execute the trust reposed in us, particularly
when it is known, that at a different
season, and under other circumstances,
the task would have been easy; but
it is still more distressing, when attended
with the anxiety to see our native country
and our dearest friends. Such were the
reflections which agitated my mind on my
return to Okotsk; and for many days they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
poisoned the pleasures that every one was
desirous of procuring me. At length, however,
the attentions I experienced, and the
amusements that poured in upon me on all
sides, dispelled my chagrin, and there was
no longer any merit in my resignation.</p>

<p>Among the officers of the garrison, I
owed peculiar obligations to M. Loftsoff,
inspector general. He gave instant orders
that the belt of their wretched horses should
be collected from the environs, and kept in
readiness to set off at a moment’s warning<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
This precaution enabled me to seize the first
favourable opportunity, which, I flattered
myself, would be sooner than they gave me
reason to expect.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kasloff, informed of my return, had
the kindness to send me every day an abundance
of milk, which she knew had been
prescribed by M. Allegretti, as the only
food that could relieve my breast. I was
the more obliged by this attention, as it
was not possible to procure milk at Okotsk
at any price.</p>

<p>In a few days I heard news that gave me
real pleasure. An express from Ingiga informed
us of M. Kasloff’s arrival in that settlement;
but he had brought no letter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the governor; and our joy soon gave place
to anxiety. In what situation had he arrived?
Why had he not written? His
health perhaps would not permit him? We
all questioned the messenger in turns, and
it was with difficulty he could convince us
of his safety; but the probability of his account,
its invariable uniformity, and our
own hopes, so natural, when the person in
question is dear to us, persuaded us at last
that our fears were vain; and in spite of
my melancholy experience of the difficulties
of the route, and the unfavourableness of
the season, blinded by my attachment, I
frequently deceived myself, and lessened the
obstacles, from my desire to see him before
my departure.</p>

<p>Okotsk being the seat of administration,
and the entrepôt of the Russian commerce
in this country, I found myself at the fountain
head of knowledge respecting these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
subjects. The society in which I lived, offered
me a thousand opportunities of instruction,
which it was impossible not to
embrace. I first applied myself to the study
of commerce, by enquiring into the causes
that gave rise to, that favoured and increased
the enterprises of the Russian colonies in
this quarter of the world. I was assisted
in my enquiries by the most enlightened
persons and the best informed merchants;
and to ascertain the truth of their accounts,
I frequently contrasted them with
each other, and compared them with the
assertions of Coxe. I beg leave to transcribe,
in this place, the notes which I minuted
down for my own information. If they
should contain any details sufficiently interesting
to obtain pardon for the digression,
I shall have gained my end, and be amply
rewarded for my labour.</p>

<p>By the conquest of the eastern part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Siberia, the Russians came into possession of
the fruitful mines with which it abounds,
and which were held in no estimation by
the inhabitants. To the extraction of iron,
the conquerors added that of silver, gold,
and other precious metals, the eternal objects
of the avarice of mankind. The discovery
of these new sources of wealth, enflamed
the courage of the adventurers; the
result was, that they were desirous of extending
their dominion still farther, and
their eager regards reached beyond Irkoutsk,
which ought on this side to have bounded
their empire.</p>

<p>Upon their first incursions into the neighbouring
countries, they perceived, with regret,
that they had not the same advantages
to hope for. Nature appeared every where
to have acted as a step-mother. The sterility
of the soil, which equalled the rigour of
the climate, and the stupid sloth of the savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
inhabitants, who were chiefly hunters,
herdsmen, or ichthyophagi, men who subsist
on fish, offered no flattering resources to industry,
and was directly calculated to check
all speculative ideas. But ingenious avarice
knew how to acquire wealth even here.
The view of the clothing of the savages,
suggested instantly the idea of robbing them
of it, and the emigrants calculated the possibility
of succeeding by the lure of exchange,
and the immense profit that would
accrue from this branch of commerce, when
it was once in their possession.</p>

<p>As they proceeded farther to the east of
Asia, it was remarked that the furs were
more beautiful; and this was sufficient to
persuade Russia that it was her interest and
glory to subject every part of this vast country
to the obedience of her laws. Hitherto
it had been the theatre of the piracies of a
herd of Cossacs and Tartars, with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
some Russians, instigated by the same spirit
of plunder, had united themselves. The
success of their attempts being known, the
allurement of riches attracted a greater
number of emigrants, whose audacity increased
in proportion to the resistance they
met with from the indigenes. In vain had
nature placed these savages in barren deserts,
in the midst of forests, where their independence
seemed to be out of the reach
of attack; in vain had she given them frosts,
mountains, and seas of ice as barriers; every
thing is surmountable by ambition, a rage
for conquest, and a thirst for riches. The
courage of the natives incited them every
day to fresh combats, but it could not save
them from oppression; the conquerors, if I
may so speak, sprung up again in proportion
as they perished in these bloody contests.
Frequent reinforcements, countenanced
by the government, repaired these
losses, and gave no time to the vanquished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
to recover from the surprise and shame of
having yielded to a handful of foreigners,
whose usurpations became more enormous
on every victory. By force of arms they
were already masters of the whole territory
as far as Okotsk, and northward had advanced
to the banks of the Anadir.</p>

<p>To secure so many advantages, a system
of government and commerce was necessary;
and immediately forts were constructed and
towns built. These establishments, paltry
as they were, opened an asylum to Russian,
and other commercial speculators, who were
acquainted with the route through these provinces.
Here they could resort, when tired
of their perilous expedition, and derive succour
against the insults of the primitive inhabitants,
who were always disposed to
throw off the yoke and make reprisals.</p>

<p>Independently of the vexations of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
kind that were exercised against them,
doubtless without the knowledge of the
court to which they were become tributary,
the natives frequently suffered still
farther from the treachery, cruelties, and
all the excesses practised by ferocious conquerors,
when intoxicated with success, and
goaded on by the abuse of riches and power,
and the hope of impunity. In practising
these barbarities, individuals were emboldened
by the example of their superiors,
even of such as were appointed to stop the
disorders, which became at last so enormous
as to excite the indignation of the empress.
The produce of the customs no longer flowed
with equal abundance into the treasury;
the tributes were either annihilated or diminished
by the persons appointed to collect
them. Hence the frequent change of
governors, whose depravity or incapacity
was justly accused, and merited at least an
instant recall. Hence the want of discipline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
among the troops, the confusion of all order
among the colonists, the daily accusations,
the murders, and all the crimes that anarchy
engenders.</p>

<p>It happened exactly the same at Kamtschatka,
when a chief of the Cossacs<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> reduced
the inhabitants of that peninsula to submit
themselves to the Russian yoke. How
heavily did it at first bear upon them! how
many troubles, how many depredations,
how many revolts did it occasion! This
intestine and cruel war ceased not till a better
mode of government was adopted.</p>

<p>A new order of things then took place;
the rights of the indigenes were more respected,
the taxes were less arbitrary, every
function was more faithfully discharged.
Freed from the shackles that loaded it, commerce
began to prosper, speculations multiplied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
the wealthy merchants of Russia
sent their factors to Okotsk, and this town
became the metropolis to other settlements
that gradually sprung up. The eligibleness
of its situation in the center of the conquered
provinces, gave it this preference,
notwithstanding the smallness of the port;
but the navigation is almost entirely confined
to coasting, and the ships that trade
to Kamtschatka are chiefly galliots.</p>

<p>The cargos which they brought back,
that is, the valuable skins obtained from
the inhabitants by way of exchange, or as
tribute, were afterwards sent to the center
of the empire, where they were sold under
the eyes, as it were, of government, and
chiefly on its account. The caprice of
the purchasers, whether natives or foreigners,
was the only standard of the
market: the art of the sellers was directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
to raise the price of their merchandise;
but from the skill of the one, and the
eagerness of the other, no real benefit accrued,
except to the revenue, in consequence
of the enormous duties levied upon every
thing that is bought and sold.</p>

<p>In the mean time Okotsk flourished, and
the number of merchant ships that arrived
in and sailed out of the port increased every
day: more considerable connections gave
rise to more extensive views.</p>

<p>Russian caravans, leaving Siberia behind
them, passed from desert to desert to the
very borders of China. After some warm
contests, and a variety of treaties infringed
and broken, it was at last settled that the
two nations should trade together on the
frontiers. This privilege, which China had
not granted to any of the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
powers, was calculated to give to Russian
commerce<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> an unbounded extension.</p>

<p>The merchants were no sooner informed
of this new market for the sale of their
furs, than they exerted themselves to procure
a greater abundance. Their vessels,
entrusted to pilots chosen from government
ships, sailed for the east of Kamtschatka.
These navigators, more daring than skilful,
were fortunate beyond what they had reason
to expect; they not only discovered
some unknown islands, but returned from
their voyage loaded with so considerable a
cargo of most beautiful skins, that the court
of Petersburg considered herself as bound
to bestow a more particular attention to
these discoveries.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>
<p>Resolved to pursue them, from the hope
of one day adding these islands to the number
of her possessions, she entrusted the execution
of her designs to the most able marine
officers, such as Behring, Tchirikoff,
Levacheff, and others equally celebrated.
Some fitted out their vessels at Okotsk, and
others sailed from the port of Avatscha, or
Saint Peter and St. Paul, at the point of
Kamtschatka; all were eager to traverse the
vast archipelago that opened before them;
all proceeded from one discovery in pursuit
of another. Copper island, Behring island,
the Aleutienne and Fox islands, were found
in turns, and new tributes enriched the royal
treasury. Having wandered a long time
over the seas, these happy Argonauts reached
the coast of America. A peninsula (that
of Alaxa) presented itself to their view;
having landed, they understood that it
formed a part of the main continent; every
thing indicated that it was the new quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
of the world, and full of joy, they sailed
back to their country.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they given an account of
the success of their voyage, proved by the
useful observations they made, when the
views of commerce were eagerly directed
towards a region that offered inexhaustible
resources. Russian factories were established
at Alaxa<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, and the immense profit accruing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
to them has, in spite of the distance, supported
ever since between the factors and
their principals, the strictest correspondence.
The following is the mode of traffic adopted
at Okotsk, whence a number of vessels sail
every year for America.</p>

<p>When a merchant has resolved to make
this voyage, either in person or by means
of one of his agents, he asks the consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
of the governor, which is seldom refused.
The cargo is divided into shares, and every
person is at liberty to purchase. The shares
amount only to the sum necessary to defray
the expences of fitting out, and purchasing
the articles of merchandise, which consist of
stuffs, iron utensils, glass trinkets, handkerchiefs,
brandy, tobacco, and other things
held in estimation by savages. The officers
and sailors have no wages, but are allowed
a part of the cargo, which is called <i>paï</i>.
The voyage lasts three, four, or six years;
and from a spirit of avarice, the vessel is
conducted to such places as are the least
frequented, and even new discoveries are
attempted<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>Upon their return, these ships undergo a
strict search. The owners pay duties to
government, regulated by the nature of
their cargoes, and estimated by the bills of
lading. An appraisement is then made of
the remainder, which is divided into equal
portions: each owner receives either in kind
or in money the amount of his capital, (allowing
for freightage, and loss) and his share
in the profits, if any have accrued. It will
readily be perceived that it is chance alone
in a manner that decides upon the quantum
of dividend or deficit. In fine, part
of the goods are sold at Okotsk, and part
transported to Yakoutsk, from thence to
Irkoutsk, and last of all to Kiakhta, where
the Chinese are the established purchasers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>The mode of government is equally entitled
to attention. During my abode in the
peninsula, the tribunals of which, as I have
already observed, hold from those of Okotsk,
I obtained the fullest information on this
subject<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. I had only therefore to consider
more attentively the discipline of the garrison,
and the police of the town, which
equally astonished me.</p>

<p>I expected to see, as it formerly was, a
licentious soldiery; that is, a band of ferocious
Cossacs, robbers by nature, and ignorant
of every law but their caprice or interest.
Not a day passed without some of
them deserting with arms and baggage, and
frequently the magazines were pillaged by
this audacious troop. It was to no purpose
that the representatives of the sovereign
practiced severity to put a stop to these desertions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
and plunderings; it was to no purpose
that all the criminals, whom it was
possible to apprehend, were subjected to the
<i>battogues</i>, or gantlet, and other punishments
practiced in the Russian army. These desperadoes
were so hardened to stripes, or so
incorrigible, that they incurred the next
day new penalties; nor could the severest
punishment restrain them, or deter others.
At present however the garrison is subjected
to a still severer discipline, and instances of
disobedience are more rare. Great praise
is due to the reformers, whose perseverance
and ability have operated such good effects.</p>

<p>Equal attention has been paid to the department
of the police, which it was no
easy task to establish in a town that has a
considerable number of exiles among its
inhabitants. The majority bear the indelible
marks with which the hand of justice
has branded their guilty heads, and the rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
condemned to the gallies, meditate incessantly
during their labours in the port, how
to break their chains with impunity. Sometimes
escapes are effected, and woe to those
places where these culprits betake themselves!
But the continual vigilance of the
governor does not long permit them to enjoy
this fatal liberty; they are soon apprehended
and punished, and by being loaded
with heavier chains, all fears for the public
safety are removed. The conduct of M.
Kokh on this occasion struck me as equally
prudent and determined; to a spirit of moderation,
which forms the essence of his
character, the utmost inflexibility is united.</p>

<p>The Lamouts, the Toungouses, and the
Yakouts, fail not also to find employment
for administration, either by the complaints
which they occasion, or by their frequent
insurrections, particularly at the time of
levying taxes. This department is intrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
to the care of M. Loftsoff, inspector general,
who, by his activity and prudence,
has the art of appeasing the tumults,
accommodating the disputes, and
executing without violence the decrees of
his sovereign. I had an opportunity of
judging how perfectly satisfied all parties
were with his conduct.</p>

<p>Such was the prosperous situation in
which I found this branch of the general
government. May the testimony which I
am desirous of giving in its favour, be contrasted
with the first accounts, and guard
the reader against the disadvantageous prejudices,
which a view of the former defective
government is calculated to inspire. The
new governors are at least intitled to this
justice, that if abuses still prevail, they exert
themselves without intermission to put a stop
to them, in proportion as such abuses become
known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>A report lately prevailed, I know not
from what authority, that there was an
intention of removing the inhabitants of
Okotsk, either to Oudskoi, or some neighbouring
settlement. If the court have
really such a project in view, it must have
felt, I should suppose, the necessity of having
a more considerable town in this quarter,
and that convenience, extent, and security,
will determine its choice of a new
port.</p>

<p>I have promised the reader some account
of the commission of M. Billings. I have already
observed, that he has two ships building
in the dock of Okotsk, but I should be
considerably at a loss to say what is their
destination. It is not possible to penetrate
the mystery; and all I know is, that M.
Billings, from his reputation, and the abilities
he displayed in one of the voyages of
captain Cook, who was his countryman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
has been invited into Russia, and, with the
rank of captain, appointed to command a
secret expedition, the object of which is supposed
to be that of discovery. The powers
accorded to him seem to be boundless; and
materials, workmen, sailors, every requisite,
in short, have been supplied by the court.</p>

<p>For the sake of dispatch, M. Billings had
divided his men, and sent a part of them to
Okotsk under the superintendance of M.
Hall, his lieutenant, to construct two vessels,
while he himself made, with the remainder,
for the Frozen Ocean, in stout sloops
and other ships hastily built in the river
Kolumé.</p>

<p>The end of this first expedition is as yet
a secret, and various conjectures are formed
respecting it. The most intelligent persons
agreed in supposing that he was to make the
circuit of this part of Asia, to double cape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Svetoï, and endeavour to return to Okotsk
by the sea of Kamtschatka. If such were
his project, it is probable that he met with
some insurmountable obstacles in its execution,
as he returned, after three months navigation,
to the river Kolumé, and sailed
from thence for Yakoutsk.</p>

<p>The armament under the direction of M.
Hall had been suspended for a considerable
part of the winter, but was revived and carried
on with vigour during my abode at
Okotsk. The hull of one vessel was already
finished, and the keel of another laid in the
dock. The ropemakers, blacksmiths, carpenters,
sailmakers, caulkers<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>, had separate
workshops. The continual presence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
superintending officers animated the zeal of
the workmen. Notwithstanding this diligence
on all sides, to which I was a witness,
I doubt whether these ships will be fit for
sea these two years.</p>

<p>The river Okhota had always been disencumbered
of its ice before 20 May; to the
great astonishment of the inhabitants it did
not begin to float this year till the 26 in the
afternoon. It was a spectacle for the town,
and I was invited as to a party of pleasure;
but from the idea that it must be similar to
what I had seen at Petersburg, I discovered
little inclination or curiosity. Importuned
however upon the subject, I went to the
river. The crowd was already assembled,
and I was immediately assailed on every side
by the unanimous vociferations of those
about me, who exclaimed in full chorus at
sight of the enormous sheets of ice which
were lifted up by the rapidity of the current.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
The noise of some seemed to drown
that of others, and the multitude flocked
together without end. The next moment
loud groans struck my ears. I endeavoured
to discover whence these cries proceeded,
and I saw a number of men and women
running like so many persons in despair
along the bank. I approached with trepidation,
persuaded that some unfortunate
child was in danger of being drowned; but
I soon discovered my error.</p>

<p>A troop of about a dozen dogs was the
cause of this lamentation. Their masters,
either from avarice or compassion, bewailed
in concert the fate of these poor animals,
whose loss seemed inevitable. Seated tranquilly
on the ice that supported them,
they looked with an air of astonishment
at the crowd collected upon the bank,
whose clamours and signs could not move
them from their posture. Two only had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the instinct to attempt to save themselves,
and gained with difficulty the opposite side;
the rest were out of sight in a few minutes,
and, conveyed into the main ocean, must
there infallibly have perished.</p>

<p>These dogs were the only victims of the
breaking up of the ice; but its effects have
been sometimes so terrible, as to have occasioned
the removal of all the houses<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> near
the river. The scattered ruins bear witness
that many of them have been overturned by
this fatal event, and I was informed, that in
the course of some years, nearly a fourth
part of the town had been destroyed by it.</p>

<p>The inhabitants wait with impatience for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the period when the river shall regain its
natural state; it is time that the fishing
season should commence, and relieve them
from the famine that begins to prevail. The
stock of fish procured in the preceding summer
had been scanty, and was nearly exhausted.
The supply of meal was also considerably
diminished, and what remained
was so dear that the common people were
unable to purchase. The humanity of M.
Kokh signalised itself on this occasion.
There was a reserve of rye flour in the
stores belonging to government, and he
distributed it among the indigent class of
the inhabitants. This afforded them some
relief, but it was not of long duration. M.
Kokh, who received a number of persons
at his table, was reduced to the necessity of
having recourse to a few eatables which he
had laid by in the preceding year. At last
we had nothing to eat but beef dried in
the sun. To get a supply of fresh provisions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
the major sent out a party to hunt
deer and argali, but they had only once the
good fortune to be successful.</p>

<p>The thaw being ended, he ordered the
seine to be immediately used. I was present
with a large party, and the spectacle
was much superior, in my opinion, to that
to which I had before been invited. It is
not easy to express the pleasure, the transport
of the multitude of spectators upon
the first cast of the net. A prodigious
quantity of small fish, like smelts and herrings,
were caught, and the joy and clamour
redoubled at the sight. The most famished
were first served, and the whole produce of
this fortunate beginning given up to them.
I could not restrain my tears on perceiving
the ravenousness of these poor creatures;
whole families contended for the fish, which
were devoured raw before my eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>To these fishing enterprises, which became
more successful every day from salmon<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>,
and other large fish coming up the river,
succeeded the diversion of hunting water
fowl<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, which were so abundant as to
cover the surface of the water: this was a
new means of subsistance for the inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the mean time the season advanced,
and in spite of the frequent fogs, we had
now and then some fine days. They were
the more acceptable, as the snow had fallen
during the night of the 29 two inches deep,
and the cold was so severe as to be one degree
below zero. The waters gradually
abated, but there was no appearance of vegetation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Some blades of rotten grass, the
melancholy fruit of the last efforts of Nature
at the close of autumn, was the only nourishment
that the earth afforded to the
horses, till the return of the genial influence
of spring.</p>

<p>I was already anxious to be gone, and
though I could not deceive myself respecting
the miserable state of these animals, I
intreated M. Kokh to order such as had been
appointed for my use to be collected, resolving
to leave Okotsk 6 June at latest.
His orders were punctually executed; and
thanks to his cares, to the kindness of
Mrs. Kasloff, and the liberality of a number
of friends, whom I left in this settlement, I
found myself all at once amply provided
with bread and biscuit. Had it not been
for the recollection of the famine, I should
have felt myself flattered by these presents;
but the idea that I was to support myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
with the sacrifices of friendship, hurt my
feelings, and it was not without considerable
pain that I was obliged to keep what
no refusals could induce them to take back.</p>

<p>The evening preceding my departure
was devoted to taking leave. I had the
pleasure to learn that M. Loftsoff intended
to accompany me to Moundoukann, and
that lieutenant Hall, called to that place
by some affairs relative to the armament
under his care, was to go with us. I had
little expected a third companion, doubly
dear to me, but M. Allegretti informed me,
that he had prepared every thing to conduct
me as far as the cross of Yudoma.
How great were my surprise and gratitude,
when I understood that personal attachment
was the sole motive of his journey!
Of my two soldiers, Golikoff only attended
me; Nedarezoff staid at Okotsk, but I took
his father to serve me as pilot on the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Yudoma. A number of workmen, as I
had agreed with the major, were to set out
immediately after me, to repair the boats,
which would be found unfit for service,
that I might not be exposed to new dangers
or new delays.</p>

<p>All my preparations being completed, I
tore myself from the arms of M. Kokh. A
number of inhabitants did me the honour
to attend me to the gates of the town,
where our horses waited for us, and where,
after mutual reiterations of good wishes,
we separated: my hosts carried with them,
I trust, the conviction, that they had not
entertained a man insensible to obligation.</p>

<p>At sight of the horse I was to mount, I
drew back with horror and compassion. I
had never seen so wretched an animal. His
sides were lank and hollow, his buttocks
narrow and peaked, so that you might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
count every bone they contained, his neck
unsupported, his head between his legs,
his haunches nerveless and weak. Such is
the exact description of my steed. You
may judge of the figure of the other
horses, among which mine passed for one
of the least despicable. The saddle had a
considerable resemblance to our own. Those
which were provided for our baggage were
smaller, made of wood, and perforated with
holes; upon the top there were two sticks
fastened cross-wise on which the load<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
was suspended, taking care however to
make the weight equal on both sides, as
the smallest disproportion would infallibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
have prevented the beasts from maintaining
their equilibrium.</p>

<p>It was in this pitiful plight that our caravan
sat out. To console ourselves for the
slow pace we travelled, each was merry at
the expence of his steed. Twelve wersts
from Okotik, a tolerably large salt work
was pointed out to me on the sea coast;
the men employed in it were all malefactors
or convicts. Beyond this house we
left the sea at our left, and travelled for
some time on the banks of the Okhota.</p>

<p>If the breaking up of this river occasion
such alarm to the inhabitants of the town,
its overflowings are not less fatal to the environs.
Rising above the banks, the water
not only floods the adjacent country, but
becomes a torrent, that swells as it extends
itself. It has been said to rise two feet
above the tops of the highest trees. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
this account one may suppose its ravages
to be dreadful, and certain it is that I saw
in the forests gulfs of an astonishing depth,
said to be the work of these floods.</p>

<p>Within a short distance from Medvejé-golova,
my horse fell under me, and it was
impossible to make him get up again; I
had fortunately time to quit the saddle, and
received therefore no injury. We left the
beast on the spot<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, where it doubtless expired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
a few hours after. We had still
eleven horses remaining; I was therefore
remounted in an instant, and reached the
village without meeting with any other
accident.</p>

<p>We proceeded the next day, at nine
o’clock in the morning, and forded the
river Okhota, the course of which we were
no longer to pursue. I perceived here and
there some Yakout yourts at a considerable
distance from each other: seldom are any
number of them seen together.</p>

<p>The disposition of these families to live
in this isolated manner, results from a
motive of interest that is of the first importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Horses being their chief source of
wealth, if the proprietors (some of whom
possess more than a thousand) built their
habitations nearer to each other, how
would they be able to procure nourishment
for their numerous studs? The neighbouring
pastures must soon be exhausted, and it
would be necessary to send multitudes of
them to a considerable distance; but how
many inconveniences would result in consequence
of the negligence or dishonesty of
the keepers.</p>

<p>Arrived at Moundoukann, our horses
were so fatigued that we passed the night
there and all the next day, which was 8
June. I have already observed that this
village is twenty wersts from Medjevé-golova;
it gives its name to a river on which
it is situated.</p>

<p>At break of day I separated from M. Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
and M. Loftsoff, who were to stay in this
place. I first climbed a high mountain
called <i>Ourak</i>, the summit of which was still
covered with snow; it reached to the bellies
of our horses, who suffered extremely in
this passage.</p>

<p>A river of the same name runs at the
foot of the mountain. It is wide, deep, and
rapid; and on its bank is a yourt inhabited
by watermen. They were at this time all
absent, probably a hunting, as their open
house indicated that they had not long been
departed.</p>

<p>Tired of calling and waiting for them,
we launched the least defective of the boats
that were fastened on the bank, and after
searching about we found some oars. We
unloaded and unsaddled the horses, and
placed the baggage in the boat, which in
turn conveyed us to the other side. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
steeds still remained, and I trembled lest
they should not be able to swim across.
The security of my Yakouts in this respect
appeared to me unaccountable; by dint of
whipping them, they forced them into the
water; the boat went before to guide them,
and one of our conductors was left on the
bank to pelt them with stones and frighten
them with his cries, so as to prevent their
turning back. In about half an hour they
all arrived safe, when they were immediately
saddled and reloaded<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, and we pursued
our journey.</p>

<p>The weakness of our horses obliged us to
halt twenty-five wersts from Moundoukann,
in a place that offered us most pasture,
and that seemed to have few traces of bears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
From a fast of six months, it is easily conceived
how much the voracity of these animals
is to be dreaded. Deserting their
dens, they prowl about the country, and
from the want of fish, with which the rivers
do not yet abound, they ravenously attack
every animal they meet, and particularly
horses. We were obliged to take precautions
even for our own safety. From the
following description, the reader will be
able to form an idea of the nature of our
halts.</p>

<p>Having fixed upon the spot, the horses
were eased of their burthens and permitted
to graze at liberty. Fires were then kindled
at equal distances round our little
camp, and at the entrance of my tent I repeatedly
discharged my musquet, being assured
that the report and smell of the powder
would terrify and drive away the bears.
At break of day our horses are assembled;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
if any of them were dispersed they came at
the cry of my Yakouts, who possess the
same talent in this respect as the Koriacs
with their rein deer.</p>

<p>Surprised at seeing tufts of horse hair
suspended to the branches of trees, I asked
the cause of it, and was informed that they
were offerings made by the people of the
country to the gods of the woods and highways.
My guides had their favourite
places, where they piously deposed similar
gifts. This superstition is at least productive
of one good effect, as the offerings
may serve to point out the road to travellers.</p>

<p>In the course of the preceding day we
had crossed various branches of the river
Ourak, the ramifications of which are infinite,
but none of them occasioned us any
delay. The 11, about five o’clock in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
afternoon, we met this river again: its
width was not very considerable, and, but
for the rain<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> that had fallen and swelled
the current, we should have felt no hesitation
in fording it as we had done in the
preceding instances. My principal guide
represented it as dangerous; but having
been forewarned that if I listened to their
advice they would frequently make me halt
even at noon day, to repose themselves rather
than from a wish to refresh their horses,
I resolved at least to have the depth founded.
The experiment however convinced
me that my guide was in the right. The
person whom I ordered to go into the river
was quickly obliged to return, as his horse
lost footing a few steps from the bank. It
was necessary to pitch our camp in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
neighbourhood, where our horses fortunately
found something to eat.</p>

<p>That I might lose less time, I restricted
myself to one regular meal in the evening,
satisfied with the refreshment of rye
biscuit in the course of the day; but I had
desired my people to inform me whenever
they perceived any game<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>, and we lived
for some time on the fruits of my success.
Necessity is an able master, and custom supplied
the want of skill.</p>

<p>If I happened to kill any small animals,
they fell to the lot of my Yakouts, except
the skins, which they returned to me. Golikoff
had given me a disgust to this food,
which I conceived from his report to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
very nauseous. Tempted however one day
by the whiteness of the flesh, when boiled,
I eat part of one of these little animals:
they taste of the fir, but are less disagreeable
than I had been led to believe. In a
time of scarcity, I should have considered
them as very acceptable, and can forgive the
Yakouts their high relish of them.</p>

<p>Their principal food, which they call
<i>bourdouk</i>, gave me infinitely more repugnance.
It is a kind of thick frumenty,
made of rye meal and water, into which,
after it is taken off the fire, they pour fish
oil: the quantity they eat of it astonished
and shocked me. I was told that in general
they were not very great eaters; it was
however added, that they now and then, as
a treat, roast a horse, which is demolished
in a few hours by a very small number of
guests, and the intestines of the animal are
by no means the least precious morsel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Who would suppose that men of such voracious
appetites, practice at other times a
frugality that seems scarcely sufficient to
support life, and frequently continue a
number of days together without food?</p>

<p>I was awaked at an early hour by my
guides, who came to inform me that the
river had considerably abated during the
night. While they were loading our baggage
a number of horsemen arrived, who
had in like manner been detained on the
opposite side; they crossed without any
risk, and inspired us with the fullest confidence.</p>

<p>They were bankrupt merchants going to
try their fortune, as factors of a man of
property, whose speculation had obtained
the concurrence of the court, and all the
succours that he wanted. Its object was
the fur trade, particularly that of sables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
caught by the Koriacs and Tchouktchis.
These factors were to separate at the mouth
of the Pengina, and advance considerably
into the country. They were allowed four
or five years for their undertaking, and
their intention was not only to collect furs
from every quarter in the way of purchase,
but to hunt themselves the animals that
furnished them. Apprehensive of no other
obstacles but what might be occasioned by
the natives, they were provided with ammunition
and arms to repel their insults.</p>

<p>In quitting us they turned an eye of
pity on our poor beasts, while we on the
contrary observed with envy the strength
and good condition of theirs. Coming
from the environs of Yakoutsk, where there
is no scarcity of winter provisions, these
horses were a perfect contrast with ours,
which appeared still more wretched from
the comparison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>When we had passed the river, I asked
my guides if I might hope that it was the
last we should cross. They replied in the
negative, informing me that we should
meet with three others in the course of the
day. From their description I judged that
they must be new branches of the Ourak.
Be this as it may, my fears increased every
time, and the idea that the horse might fall
with my box, made me shudder.</p>

<p>Upon coming out of a thick wood, I
found myself on the bank of a real torrent,
the stream was so rapid, and the breadth
of the river scarcely less than two hundred
yards; at a little distance it poured itself
into the Ourak. In the mean time we
conceived it to be fordable, and with this
confidence I spurred my horse to make him
descend. In the middle of the river I felt
his legs tremble. I encouraged him; he
proceeded, and the water now reached no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
farther than my knee. Emboldened by
this circumstance, I placed myself firm in
my seat, having been thrown something off
my center by a sort of dizziness which the
continual view of the current perpetually
excited. Already I approached the opposite
bank, the climbing of which required
new efforts. To ascend it, it was necessary
to surmount a ridge of ice which still remained
attached to it. The declivity was
steep, but it would have been in vain to
have fought for a better landing-place. My
resolution was soon taken, and I directed
the animal towards the perilous ascent;
already he had gained a position for his
fore feet, and he rested them as well as he
could to bring forward his hind ones. He
lost his footing, and fell backward into the
water; the horse and the rider floated in
different parts of the stream. The water
was deep, and the cumberousness of my
dress restrained my efforts. Both the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
and myself were carried along by the
violence of the current, and I insensibly
grew weaker. I was approaching the place
where the two rivers joined, when on a sudden
I heard a voice saying, “Catch at the
bridle of your horse, or it is over with
you!” The sound, the idea of the danger
re-animated me; I struck forward with all
my strength, stretched out my hand, and
seized the rein. Providence was undoubtedly
watchful for my preservation, for at
the same moment my horse took footing
and breath; an instant later, and we had
been lost. I slided my hand to the upper
end of the bridle, and then threw my arms
strongly round the neck of the animal.
Thus I remained suspended as it were between
life and death, not daring to move
a finger, and calling aloud for succour. My
faithful Golikoff had in vain endeavoured to
follow me in my misfortune; the vigour of
his horse did not correspond to the zeal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the rider; anxious and impatient, it was he
that had given me the salutary and terrible
advice of grasping at my horse; and no
sooner did he perceive its happy effects,
than he hastened on his part to climb the
shore. To land, to run towards me, to lay
hold of my horse and drag him out of the
water, and to restore me to life, was all the
affair of five minutes.</p>

<p>My first care, having leaped on the neck
of my deliverer, was to tear off the port-folio
which was fastened to my girdle. In
spite of the oil case in which it was enveloped
the water had penetrated into it,
and I trembled for the fate of two important
packets which count de la Perouse
had particularly recommended to my care.
I had the pleasure to find that they were
but little injured.</p>

<p>My box I had left on the other side; my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
uneasiness respecting it was soon dispelled
by the arrival of M. Allegretti and my
other companions, who placed it in my
hands. They were still pale and dismayed
at the accident I had encountered, and considered
it as a miracle that I had been able
to save myself. I had seen death too near
me, not to be of the same opinion.</p>

<p>We again mounted our horses, but I
confess that my blood froze in my veins,
when we approached a river; I took care
in future to send one of my guides before,
and was not free from apprehension till
he made me a signal from the opposite
bank.</p>

<p>During this day, as well as in every preceding
one since our departure from Okotsk,
we constantly travelled through forests, or
along the banks of rivers. In the woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the trees<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> that line the roads are small,
but so bushy and so beset with briars, that
my Yakouts were frequently obliged to clear
the way with their hatchets<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>, which still
slackened our pace, though we never went at
a greater rate than a walk.</p>

<p>I arrived in tolerable time at Oratskoï-plodbisché.
This was the first habitation I
had seen since the yourt belonging to the
watermen, and I spent there the rest of the
day. The river Ourak flows at the foot of
this hamlet; the number of inhabitants
amounts only to five soldiers, each of whom
has an isba. They are appointed to guard
a magazine for the reception of effects belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
to the crown, sent from Okotsk or
Yakoutsk. Upon occasion they convey the
merchandize as far as the mouth of the
Ourak; but this river is so obstructed, sometimes
with flats and sometimes with cataracts,
and the embarkations at the same
time are so weak, that the navigation is
equally painful and dangerous.</p>

<p>The next morning, which was the 13,
I crossed this river in a boat; it takes its rise
at no great distance, from an immense lake
where we halted in the evening. The lake
is situated upon an eminence, is about seven
wersts in circumference, and is said to abound
with fish.</p>

<p>I cannot pass over in silence a scene that
took place this day among my Yakouts,
respecting a horse that it was necessary to
leave in the road. They had stopped, and
were holding a consultation round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
animal. Impatient at seeing no end to their
discussion, I was about to witness my discontent,
when they forestalled me, intreating
my indulgence for the delay they occasioned
me. Accountable for the horses
committed to their care, it is customary,
when they lose any of them either by accident
or from excess of fatigue, to cut off the
tail and the ears, which they are obliged to
produce to the proprietor to exculpate themselves,
or pay the value of the animals. The
dispute at present was, whether they should
put an end to the poor dying beast. This
required some time, which I was not in a
humour to sacrifice to them, and I replied
therefore somewhat angrily, that there was
a more simple, more expeditious, and less
cruel way of effecting this end. I promised
them a certificate, that should attest the loss
and supply the place of the usual proofs,
by taking the blame of their failure in this
respect upon myself. They acquiesced without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
hesitation in my proposal, and this deference
was no small proof, I was told, of
their respect.</p>

<p>From the hope of travelling quicker, I
committed our baggage to the care of old
Nedarezoff, and went on before with M.
Allegretti, Golikoff, and a Yakout. A pond
presented itself, the depth of which might
be about a foot. I rode into it with M. Allegretti,
and Golikoff followed holding my
box on his saddle. He had scarcely advanced
ten steps when the horse stumbled and threw
him off sideways; but more intent upon his
deposit than his own preservation, he fell
upon the box, having taken care not to relinquish
his hold. I immediately alighted
to assist him; but having fallen in the mire,
he had sustained no injury. His greatest
trouble proceeded from my box being wet,
but I consoled him by shewing him that the
water had not touched the inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Our horses were so fatigued, that we
were obliged to alight and lead them by
the bridle, while the Yakout whipped them
severely behind. We travelled in this
manner the whole day, resting every half
hour, where the new grass<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> began to appear,
in order to recover in some measure
our poor beasts.</p>

<p>About three o’clock in the afternoon we
arrived at the cross of Yudoma<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. On an
eminence, secure from the overflowings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
this river, which extends its impetuous waves
to a great distance, are a number of magazines
guarded by four soldiers, and which
serve them as an asylum when their common
habitations by the side of the Yudoma
are flooded: these soldiers practice also the
business of watermen, and are at the service
of travellers.</p>

<p>Upon seeing my passport they submitted
themselves entirely to my disposal.
Unfortunately all their boats were in a condition
the most wretched that can be imagined,
and we had neither materials nor
workmen to refit them. Those who had
been sent from Okotsk were not likely to
arrive soon, and I was impatient to embark<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
in order to sail down the rivers Yudoma,
Maya, and Aldann. Among these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
soldiers, one only had ever made this voyage,
and nine years having since elapsed, he
had totally forgotten the course. I was advised
not to try him, unless all the others
refused.</p>

<p>My only resource therefore was Nedarezoff,
who had attended me in order to
serve as pilot; but what a pilot! He had
once, twelve years ago, been upon this river,
and all he remembered was, that he was
three years in going from Yakoutsk to
Okotsk. He conducted at that time a considerable
convoy of timber, anchors, cordage,
and other materials for fitting out an
armament.</p>

<p>Of the four boats that were on the strand,
I chose the best and the narrowest, which
was twelve feet long by six wide<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
examining it, I found that it must be caulked,
tarred, and have an additional plank at
the head to enable it to resist the force of
the waves. With two boards, and some
nails from an old boat, one of the soldiers,
who understood a little the trade of a carpenter,
effected the latter part of the business,
but we wanted every material for the
other repairs. We ransacked the magazines
to no purpose, and during the whole
night I ceased not to puzzle my brain in
order to invent some expedient.</p>

<p>At break of day, as I was going to visit
the workmen, I trod on an old and large
cord that lay on the bank. Elate with my
good fortune, I carried it to my soldiers;
instantly it was cut to pieces, and unravelled;
we had thus a supply of tow, and the
three most important leaks were stopped.
The difficulty was to fasten and keep in the
tow; my workmen proposed to me to cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the chinks with laths, but we had no nails
of any sort. Necessity is the mother of
invention. With a wimble, which was the
only tool we had, we made holes round the
leaky places; some small cord, which I
found in my baggage, being passed through
them, and the holes afterwards filled up
with pegs, the laths were so firmly fastened
as to prevent the water from penetrating
the boat. At three o’clock in the afternoon
our repairs were completed, the helm fixed,
and the oars adjusted; and I ordered my
people to be ready by the next morning.</p>

<p>When we were just on the point of setting
off, a caravan of Yakoutsk merchants appeared;
they were going to Okotsk, and I
entreated M. Allegretti to embrace the opportunity
of accompanying them. Our separation
took place at nine o’clock. On
leaving him, all the services he had rendered
me, and the proofs of attachment he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
had evinced, presented themselves to my
view, and made an impression on my heart.</p>

<p>I engaged two of the soldiers to row me,
one of whom was the man that had before
made this voyage; Nedarezoff was at the
helm; and Golikoff and I were to relieve
him when he should be tired. The rapidity
of the current carried us on with such
violence, that we could easily dispense with
the oars. At the rate we sailed my soldiers
had no doubt that we should reach the famous
cataract before night, which was more
than eighty wersts from the place of our departure.
Their conversation turned solely
upon the dangers we should have to encounter.
Though I was already prepossessed
with the idea of their inexperience,
by continually hearing these discourses, dictated
by fear, I began at last to be alarmed
myself, and resolved to act with all possible
prudence, that I might have no reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
reproach myself. I frequently went on
shore, and walked along the river to see
how far the navigation was safe. Towards
the evening a west north-west wind, brought
on rain. Rather than run any risk in such
bad weather I halted, and ordered my tent
to be pitched over the boat.</p>

<p>The next day, after four hours navigation,
interrupted by frequent landings to
observe the approach of the cataract, we at
last perceived it. Accompanied by my two
pilots, I went to examine the spot. At a
short distance from it I saw a little stony
island, which is only perceptible when the
waters begin to fall. My soldiers advised
me to pass, if the waters were sufficiently
high, by the way of a canal which we should
find at the right; though the descent was
very rapid, they assured me that it was nothing
in comparison with that of the cataract.
This advice engrossed my whole attention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and having convinced myself of its
utility, I returned to the boat, resolved to
put it in practice. I encouraged my people
in the best manner I could, and then took
the helm. Nedarezoff sat by me, and Golikoff
assisted one of the rowers, for we had
only two oars. We proceeded in this manner
till we reached the conflux of the two
streams, one of which led to the canal, and
the other lost itself in the cataract. The
impetuosity of the latter would have drawn
us into the abyss, but for the skill and strength
of my rowers. The instant the signal is
given, their nervous arms are stretched to
strike the oar, and to struggle against the
waves; the waters rage and foam, and the
violent shocks they give to our boat, my unceasing
exhortations, and more than all the
fear of being destroyed, redouble the ardour
of my soldiers. We are at length extricated
from the treacherous current, and
enter into the canal. How smooth did its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
waters appear after this terrifying passage!
To give my people rest, I abandoned myself
to the gentle declivity of the stream:
the helm was sufficient to direct the boat.</p>

<p>When we were at the foot of the cataract,
curiosity led me to turn my head. I trembled
at its dreadful aspect, and thanked heaven
for having afforded me a different way.
Nine boats out of ten that should attempt
this passage, would infallibly be wrecked:&mdash;the
reader shall judge.</p>

<p>What must be the fate of so small and
feeble a float, if, in defiance of danger, it
should be permitted to follow the course
of the torrent? In its precipitate descent,
I see it the sport of the waves that roll one
upon another, and fall with a deafening
noise from a height of twenty feet upon
three enormous rocks concealed by the
foam, and over which it must necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
pass. Without a miracle, how should it
avoid sinking, or escape the being dashed
to pieces? Meanwhile, when the water is
so low as to render the canal not navigable,
there is no other way left. My guides informed
me that the boats were always unladed
before the risk was attempted, and
that this was all the precaution that was
taken, and all the skill that could be displayed
by the pilots. These cataracts are
called <i>porog</i>.</p>

<p>We had still a difficult pass to make, that
terrified my people; it is called <i>Podporojenei</i>,
or the ebb of the cataract, which is about
the distance of a werst from it. They
were still talking of it when we arrived, and
I had scarcely time to explain to them the
manœuvre which I thought it necessary to
practice. Our object was to choose the
deepest side; the blackness of the water
seemed to point it out, and I steered towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
it. The multiplicity and bulk of the waves
tossed us about with more violence than if
we had been in the open sea. All at once
our boat was pitched upon a rock that was
on a level with the water, and which none
of us had perceived. We were thrown
down by the force of the shock; my companions
imagined themselves to be lost, and
had not the courage to raise themselves; it
was in vain I called upon them to row on;
they paid no attention to my cries. I
caught hold of the helm, and perceiving
that the boat had sustained no injury, I animated
their drooping spirits, and prevailed
on them to take their stations. We owed
our safety to the moss with which the rock
was covered; the boat touched it in its
passage, and glided along without suffering
any damage.</p>

<p>To avoid this accident, it is necessary to
pass exactly in the middle of the stream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
and to pay no attention to the waves which
rise, and seem to break against the rocks.
The passage is about three hundred yards.
At the bottom of this podporojenei, another
river empties itself; the clearness of its
water, and the smoothness of its current by
the side of the agitation and turmoil of the
Yudoma, form so striking a contrast, that
the eye for a long time distinguishes the one
from the other.</p>

<p>At the left of this last is another arm
equally formidable, and which is called
<i>Tschortofskoï-protok</i>, or devil’s arm. It pours
itself into the Yudoma about thirty wersts
from where this river joins the Maya. It is
known by the number of rocks and dead
trees that obstruct its entrance; if you are
not careful to steer constantly to the right,
you are drawn in by a very rapid current,
and your ruin is inevitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>I hoped to kill a bear that was prowling
on the bank; I loaded my gun with deer-shot,
and fired at it, but in spite of its
wound it fled to the woods, and I lost sight
of it. The next moment a beautiful rein
deer started fifteen paces before me, but my
gun not being charged, it escaped. I saw
also a number of argalis, swans, geese, and
a fox, but I could reach none of them.</p>

<p>This day I perceived, for the first time
since my departure from Yudomskoi-krest,
a forest of pine trees. To make up for it, I
had not been able to count the numerous
woods of firs that presented themselves to
my view, both on the right and left, and it
is this tree<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> that furnishes the masts and
other timber used in all the dock yards on
this coast.</p>

<p>I felt myself indisposed by the attack of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
fever, but I paid no great attention to it; I
merely laid myself down in the boat, and
observed no other regimen than that of
drinking cold water. We no longer halted
during the night, as our navigation was
become perfectly easy.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the assertions I had
heard, I could not easily believe that the
Ourak was more rapid than the Yudoma.
We sailed on the latter ten, twelve, and frequently
fifteen wersts an hour. Its most
regular direction appeared to be west, and
it forms at its mouth a great number of
small islands.</p>

<p>I entered the Maya on the 22, at two
o’clock in the morning, and proceeded in a
direction nearly north, but inclining now
and then to the east. The banks of this
river are less steep, less dreary than those of
the preceding, though at intervals there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
mountains and even rocks. The difference
of the current was still more perceptible, as
we only sailed four wersts an hour.</p>

<p>About noon we met nine boats loaded
with a variety of military stores for M.
Billings’ expedition. They were drawn by
men, and were going up the rivers that we
had descended. I was not able to approach
them, but I knew that they were bound
for Okotsk, under the command of M.
Behring, son of the navigator, to whom
Russia owes such interesting discoveries on
the north-west coast of America. He expected,
I was told, to be six weeks in performing
what had cost us only four days.</p>

<p>The gnats became troublesome to us to a
degree that was almost insupportable. We
had no other way of keeping them off than
by the smoke of rotten wood, with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
we were obliged to make an incessant fire in
the night as well as in the day.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the 23, I quitted the
river Maya for another, larger and more
rapid, called the Aldann<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; but I merely
crossed it, in order to gain a habitation on
the other side, opposite to the mouth of the
Maya<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<p>I found there some marines belonging to
M. Billings’s expedition, who advised me to
embrace the opportunity of a number of
horses of burthen, lately arrived, and that
would on their return convey me as far as
<i>Amgui</i>. According to my itinerary, I was
to go by water to <i>Belskaïa-pereprava</i>, which
is in the usual course from Okotsk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Yakoutsk, but in going by way of Amgui
I should considerably shorten it. This certainty,
and the happy chance that provided
me with horses, induced me to alter my
previous plan.</p>

<p>I paid my guides<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>, and as their orders
were to leave the boat at Belskaïa-pereprava,
which was a hundred and fifty wersts farther,
they continued their course on the
Aldann. They were not a werst from me,
when I repented the having dismissed them.
The Yakouts, to whom the horses belonged,
and who were apprehensive of fatiguing
them too much, heard with regret that I
intended to make use of them. Not daring
openly to refuse me, they endeavoured to
escape by stealth: they were pursued, and
by dint of promises brought back. To make
sure of them we were obliged to shut them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
all up in one isba, from which they were not
permitted to come out till they had consented
to conduct me to Amgui; the precaution
had in the mean time been taken of selecting
ten of the best horses for my use.</p>

<p>After a good night’s rest, which effectually
recovered me from my slight indisposition,
I gaily mounted my horse, accompanied
by the Yakouts, who had been lectured
by Golikoff, and were become more
docile. I was astonished at their good humour,
which made them sing the whole
way.</p>

<p>Their music is by no means agreeable,
and consists of a monotonous and continual
shake in the throat. They are however
great improvvisatori. Their words cost
them no labour or efforts of genius, and the
subject is derived from whatever passes before
them, or occurs to their mind. If a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
bird flies by their side, they will make a
song of it that shall last for an hour. Not
that their imagination accumulates ideas;
the song, on the contrary, is nothing more
than an endless repetition of the words,
<i>Lo! the bird in his flight!</i></p>

<p>For the space of a hundred wersts we
travelled across a moving swamp, in which
our horses sunk so deep that we were
obliged to alight in order to assist in extricating
them; the rest of the way was not
so bad. In the midst of a large wood, I
saw upon the border of a lake two fishermen
employed in making their winter provisions.
Their whole habitation was merely
a roof made of the bark of trees; when
the summer is at an end, they seek among
their relations a less exposed and warmer
retreat.</p>

<p>The 25, we had a great deal of rain, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
while I halted, which was from
four o’clock in the afternoon till eight in
the evening. My Yakouts, to defend themselves
from it, placed upon their shoulders a
bears’ skin in the manner of a cape. The
tail of a horse, fixed in the large handle of
a whip, served to keep off the flies. We
were so harassed by them, that I hesitated
not in having recourse to this species of fly
flap.</p>

<p>The 26 furnished nothing remarkable.
I arrived in the evening at the border of the
river Amga, two hundred wersts from the
harbour of the mouth of the Maya. Its
depth took from us all desire of crossing it
by fording, and the boats in the mean time
were all on the opposite side. We called
for assistance, but it was to no purpose.
Out of patience at seeing no person appear,
one of my Yakouts stripped himself, and
swam over to fetch us a boat. The crossing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
of our whole caravan was not completed
in less than an hour. We immediately
mounted our horses, in order to
reach the habitation of a Yakout prince,
named Girkoff. In our way I saw a number
of yourts, but they were all at least a
werst from one another. At a little distance
from that of the <i>knesetsk</i>, or prince, Golikoff
went on before, to endeavour to procure
us a good reception.</p>

<p>The prince really showed me great civility;
he not only offered me his yourt, and
treated me with milk and excellent butter,
but promised that his best horses<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> should
the next day be at my service. Being informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
that I stood in need of repose, he
pointed out the hut he had destined for me,
and while it was preparing, he had the politeness
to show me the conveniences of his
yourt, which was one of the best I had yet
seen.</p>

<p>The size of these houses varies according
to the wealth of the proprietor, and the
number of his family. Beams, placed by
the side of one another, and plastered with
clay, form the walls, which are not like ours,
perpendicular. Inclining towards the top,
they support a roof, the slope of which is
very inconsiderable: in some yourts the
roof is supported by posts. The house has
but one door, and is divided, as I have already
observed, into two apartments. The
cleanest is inhabited by the family, who
sleep in distinct huts, distributed at equal
distances against the walls, and which I can
compare to nothing better than the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
cabins in Dutch ships: every couple have a
hut to themselves. The other part of the yourt
is for the cattle, and is nothing more
than a stable. In the center of the building is
a round chimney made of wood, and guarded
from accidents by a thick clay covering.
When they light a fire, the wood is placed
perpendicularly. Cross beams are occasionally
placed in the chimney, upon which
they hang their kettles, and these are repeated,
in proportion to the number of vessels
they have to boil.</p>

<p>In one corner of the yourt a leathern
trough is fixed, and mare’s milk every day
put into it, and stirred with a stick, similar
to what is made use of in churning butter.
Every person who enters, the women particularly,
before they attend to any other
business, stir the milk a few minutes; it is
by this means they procure that sourish,
but at the same time pleasant beverage, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
<i>koumouiss</i>. If allowed to ferment, it becomes
a very potent liquor.</p>

<p>My host spoke the Russian language tolerably
well<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>; I embraced the opportunity of
drawing from him some information respecting
the customs, manners, and religion
of his countrymen, which I shall insert in
this place, together with some notes that I
had before made on these subjects.</p>

<p>When summer commences, they leave
their winter habitations, and with their families,
and a small number of horses, go to
make their harvests of fodder for consumption
during the frost season. They repair to
a considerable distance from their yourt, and
to the most fertile cantons. In their absence,
the horses are left to the care of
the servants, and the neighbouring pastures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
serve for the maintenance of all their
herds.</p>

<p>I very much regret the not having been
present at their festival in the month of
May, in celebration of the return of spring.
They assemble in the open country, where
they roast oxen and horses; and being supplied
with an abundance of fermented koumouiss,
they eat and drink to satiety, dancing
and singing at intervals, and concluding at
last with necromancies. Their chamans
preside in these festivals, and deal out their
extravagant predictions.</p>

<p>These sorcerers are more at liberty and
more revered than in Kamtschatka. Regarded
as interpreters of the gods, they
grant their mediation to the stupid Yakout,
who implores it with trembling, but always
pays for it. I have seen these dupes give
their finest horse to conduct a chaman to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
village. Nothing can be more frightful
than the magic exhibitions of these impostors.
As I knew nothing of them but from
report, I was desirous of being present. I
was astonished at the veracity of the account
that had been given me: as I have already
accurately related it<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>, I shall content myself
with describing the chaman that exhibited
before me.</p>

<p>Dressed in a habit that was ornamented
with bells and plates of iron, which made a
deafening noise, he beat besides on a <i>bouben</i>,
or tabor, with a degree of force that was
terrifying. He then ran about like a maniac,
with his mouth open, and his head
turned in every direction. His black deshevelled
hair<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> concealed his face, and beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
it proceeded at one moment real
groans, the next tears and sobs, and then
loud peals of laughter, the usual preludes
of these revelations.</p>

<p>In the idolatry of the Yakouts, we find
all the absurdities and superstitious practices
of the ancient Kamtschadales, Koriacs,
Tchouktchis, and other inhabitants of these
countries. They have however some more
solid principles; and amidst the ridiculous
fictions under which they are buried, we
meet with ideas ingenious enough respecting
the supreme being, miracles, and future
rewards and punishments.</p>

<p>But I was chiefly struck with the vivacity
and singularity of their turn of mind. They
delight in the fables drawn from their absurd
mythology, and they relate them with
all the confidence of credulity itself. By
comparing them with our own, one is tempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
no longer to hold in such esteem our ancient
and modern fabulists, when we see this
species of composition cultivated by such rivals.
The two following fables were translated
for me by Golikoff, word for word.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There arose one day in a large lake, a violent contest between
the different species of fish. The question was the establishment
of a tribunal of supreme judges, whose business
it should be to govern the whole finny tribe. The herring,
and most diminutive fish, conceived that they had
as much right to the prerogative as the salmon. From one
thing to another the dispute became so warm that the small
fish united in a body against the large, who took advantage
of their weakness to insult and persecute them. Hence
intestine and bloody wars that end in the destruction of one
of the two parties. The vanquished, who escaped from
being killed, fled to the small canals, and left the large fish,
who had the victory, masters of the lake. Such is the law
of the strongest.</p></blockquote>

<p>The other fable bears a greater resemblance
to our old women’s tales, with which
children are terrified, and the tediousness
of a rustic evening beguiled. I should be
apt to suspect that it was the production of
a chaman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A Yakout had failed in respect, or done some injury to
his chaman. The devil, to avenge the latter, transformed
himself into a cow; and, having mixed in the herd, contrived,
while it was feeding by the side of a wood, to steal
the finest heifers. In the evening when the herdsman returned,
his enraged master ascribed all the loss to his negligence,
and drove him from his house. Immediately the
devil appeared in the dress of a herdsman, an agreement was
made, and the next day he drove the cows to field. One,
two days passed, and the Yakout saw nothing of his herd.
In his distress he went with his wife, searched every where
for his cows, and at last found them&mdash;but in what disorder!
Upon his approach they began to skip and dance to the
sound of the flute<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> of the perfidious herdsman. The master
stormed and raved. “Hold there,” said the devil to
him. “It well becomes thee indeed, who hast abused the
confidence of the most respectable of chamans, to accuse
me of stealing thy herd. May this serve thee as a
lesson, and teach thee to give to every man that which
belongs to him.” Upon this the herd and the herdsman
disappeared, and the poor Yakout lost all his property.</p></blockquote>

<p>The place where this scene passed, has
since that time been considered as the abode
of infernal spirits. The incredulous scruple
not to assert that the devil who stole the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
cows, was no other than the chaman himself;
but such is the simplicity of the honest
Yakouts, that they feel a repugnance at this
suspicion, and treat it as horrible blasphemy.</p>

<p>Remains of old tombs of the Yakouts
were frequently pointed out to me in the
woods. They were coffins clumsily made,
and suspended on the branches of trees. I
know not from what motive they have renounced
this custom of exposing their dead
in the open air, and at a distance from their
habitations; but at present their mode of
interment is similar to that of Christians.</p>

<p>The funerals are attended with a kind of
pomp more or less magnificent, in proportion
to the rank and wealth of the defunct. If
a prince, he is arrayed in his finest habits,
and most splendid arms. The body, placed
in a coffin, is carried by the family to the
tomb; deep groans announce the solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
procession. His favourite horse, and another
the best of his stud, both richly caparisoned,
and led by a valet, or near relation, walk by
the side of the corpse. When arrived at
the burying place, they are tied to two
stakes<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> fixed near the grave, and while the
master is interred, their throats are cut over
the corpse. This bloody libation is the homage
paid to his attachment to these animals,
who are supposed to follow him into
the other world, where it is imagined that
he will again be able to enjoy them. They
are then flayed; the head and hide, in one
entire piece, are fixed horizontally upon the
branches of trees at a small distance from
the grave; and such is the memorial that is
erected. A fire is then kindled, and the
last proof of friendship for the deceased
consists in roasting and eating upon the spot
these favoured animals. The feast being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
concluded the company disperses. The
same ceremonial is observed for a woman,
except that instead of a horse, they sacrifice
her favourite cow.</p>

<p>The Yakouts are robust, and in general
large. They resemble the Tartars in the
cast of their features, and there is said also
to be a great similarity in the idioms of
these two people; I can only affirm that
the Yakouts are very abrupt in their manner
of speaking, and do not connect their
words.</p>

<p>Their dress is simple, and nearly the same
all the year round, the only difference is,
that in winter it is made of skins. Over
their chemise they commonly wear a large
striped waistcoat with sleeves. Their breeches
do not extend below the middle of the
thigh, but their long boots, called <i>sarri</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
reach above the knee. In hot weather they
wear nothing but the breeches.</p>

<p>They pretend to ride better than any
other nation in the world, and their vanity
in this respect is carried so far, that they
avoid, from a sentiment of disdain, giving
to travellers their most mettlesome steeds<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<p>Polygamy forms a part of the political
code of these people. Obliged to make
frequent journies, a Yakout has a wife in
every place where he stops, but he never
assembles them together. Notwithstanding
this licence, they are jealous to excess, and
the sworn enemies of whoever shall dare to
violate the rights of hospitality.</p>

<p>Thanks to the cares of prince Girkoff, I
found when I awoke nine excellent horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
ready saddled<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. He wished me to ride his
favourite horse, because it ambled with perfect
ease. Overwhelmed with his civilities,
I left him the 27 at an early hour, with the
consoling hope of more frequently meeting
with habitations, where I might sometimes
rest myself, and get a fresh supply of steeds.</p>

<p>A few paces from the preceding habitation,
which is called <i>Amguinskoi-stanovie</i>, or
Amgui halt, I saw in the road wooden images
of a bird about the size of a duck, or a cormorant;
they are emblematical representations
of a malicious divinity, the terror of
the whole canton. The most absurd stories
are told upon this subject; it is said, for
example, that this diabolical spirit has frequently
led travellers out of their road, and
devoured their horses.</p>

<p>I alighted in the evening at the house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
another Yakout prince<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, who had just settled
himself in his summer habitation, which
seemed to be equally neat and pleasant. I
shall here insert a description of their <i>ourassis</i>,
for such is the name by which these picturesque
dwellings are called.</p>

<p>Like the yourts of the wandering Koriacs,
they are circular, spacious, and constructed
with poles, fewer in number, but
ranged in the same manner, and kept asunder
by a sort of hoops at the top; the whole
covered in with the bark of the birch tree<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>,
formed into pieces eighteen inches wide,
placed in a downward direction. These
pieces are edged with a kind of ribband
equally made of this bark, and shaped into
festoons, and the inside of the yourt is ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
in the same manner. The taste of
these ornaments is governed by the caprice
of the proprietor, and there is in them a
sort of wildness that is sufficiently amusing.
The same decoration is annexed to the chairs
and beds of the heads of families. The
domestics lie upon the ground on mats or
skins, and the fire is lighted in the middle
of the house.</p>

<p>The 28, I came to the river Sola, and rode
for a considerable time along its banks.
The heat incommoded me as much as the
flies, and I was so thirsty that I stopped at
every yourt to drink koumouiss.</p>

<p>The next morning I reached a place called
<i>Yarmangui</i>, which is two hundred wersts from
Amgui, and on the border of the Lena. By
crossing this river I should be at Yakoutsk;
but by a regulation of the governor, every
traveller was obliged to wait here till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
had permission to enter the town. Disagreeable
as was this kind of quarantine, I
had reconciled myself to it, when a subaltern
officer requested me to go two hundred yards
farther, where I should find the inspector
general, and a lieutenant belonging to Mr.
Billings. They were informed of my arrival,
and received me with the most flattering
demonstrations of esteem and joy. I
had no sooner explained to them how much
the delay with which I was threatened
would counteract my views, than they gave
instant orders for my being conducted to
the other side of the river, adding, that they
were sure of the approbation of the governor,
to whom I had long since been announced
and recommended.</p>

<p>At noon I entered the boat provided for
me, and was four hours in crossing the Lena
in a diagonal direction. As far as I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
judge by my eye, this river cannot be less
than two leagues wide.</p>

<p>When landed, I was interrogated by an
officer of the police, who, as was customary,
led me to the apartment which he thought
proper to fix upon for my residence. I requested
him to direct me to the house of
M. Marklofski, the governor, whom I immediately
visited. He received me with the
utmost politeness, conversing entirely in
French, which seemed very familiar to him.
After complimenting me upon the rapidity
of my journey<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, and my fortunate arrival,
he invited me to stay a few days at Yakoutsk,
to recover myself from my fatigue.</p>

<p>But of all his obliging offers, nothing
flattered me more than his engaging me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
sup the same evening with M. Billings. I
had a strong desire to be acquainted with
him, and I waited with impatience till the
hour arrived. Our common profession of
travellers, gave us a degree of familiarity the
moment we met, and we might have been
taken for old acquaintance; in the mean
time we were both perfectly reserved upon
the subject of our respective missions, carefully
avoiding in conversation every thing
that might lead to it. I admired the delicacy
and prudence of M. Billings in this respect:
during my stay I dined once at his
house, and we met every morning and evening
at the governors<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>; but during our intercourse
not a single indiscreet question escaped
him.</p>

<p>He very much regretted the not having
met in his cruize the frigates of our expedition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
He would have considered it as a happiness
and honour to have executed the
generous intentions of his mistress, by furnishing
the count de la Perouse with every
assistance in his power. It is a debt that he
owed, but had no other way of discharging,
he said, except towards me. There was in
reality no sort of kindness that he did not
shew me.</p>

<p>Riding having extremely fatigued me, I
was advised to sail up the Lena as far as
Irkoutsk. This was the more agreeable to
me, as it would give me time to recover, and
as the delay it would occasion could not be
more than four or five days. As soon as I
had resolved upon it, M. Billings assisted
me in procuring a boat, ordered two sails to
be made of my tent, gave me one of his
trusty soldiers for a pilot, and in short furnished
me with every thing that might be
useful in my passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>The five days that I stayed at Yakoutsk
were spent in preparations for my departure.
I had leisure however to remark that
this was the most pleasant and populous
town I had yet seen in the whole extent of
country through which I had passed.</p>

<p>It is built on the western side of the
Lena; the houses are of wood, but large
and commodious; that of the governor faces
the port. The majority of the churches
are of stone. The port, which is dry at low
water, is formed by an arm of the river<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>,
that, in describing an angle, flows under
the walls of the town. The vessels that
trade here are merely barks; the greater
part of them are used for transporting the
provisions sent by government, such as salt
and flour. The merchants hire or purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
these boats, for the conveyance of their
commodities, from the neighbourhood of
the source of the Lena, where they are
built.</p>

<p>The Yakouts come not to the town but
when business obliges them; it is almost
wholly inhabited by Russians. The effects
of civilization are perceptible in their manners
and customs; the social spirit, and the
gaiety that is diffused among them, concur,
with the interests of commerce, to keep up
among the inhabitants that active intercourse
which is the source of wealth, and
augments the pleasures of life<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p>Having supplied myself with a fresh stock
of provisions, I left Yakoutsk 5 July at one
o’clock in the morning. In the northern
latitudes, it is known, that for more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
week the interval between day and night is
scarcely perceptible. Already therefore the
twilight announced the approach of the sun,
and we could perfectly distinguish the sand
banks that line this river as far as the first
stage. Not being able always to avoid them,
my guides, or rather the men who drew my
boat, besought us every instant to place ourselves
in the water like them, to assist in
hauling it over the shoals. Frequently
also, notwithstanding the enormous width
of the river, we resolved to row a cross, with
the hope of finding a more easy passage;
but in this attempt the violence of the current
drifted us half a werst, more or less,
back again. Large pieces of ice were still
visible on the bank, and would continue so,
I was informed, all the year.</p>

<p>I shall not give a regular account of every
day’s navigation. The observations it furnished
are too little interesting not to spare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the reader the tiresome uniformity of such
details.</p>

<p>The stages are estimated by stations, and
are frequently thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy,
and even eighty wersts<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. The reader
may judge from this of the labour of
those unfortunate beings who are condemned
to this service, that is, to haul the boats
from one station to another. For the space
of twelve hundred wersts, this terrible employment
is the punishment inflicted on
convicts and malefactors. They share this
labour with horses; but when the boat runs
aground, the beast is supplied by a man, and
then he has the most difficult passes to surmount.
The only relief afforded to these
culprits is a small quantity of flour allowed
by government. The Yakout princes in
the neighbourhood are obliged also to contribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
to their support, and in case of need,
to assist them with men and horses.</p>

<p>Many of these miserable beings are married;
they retire with their families in isbas
that are half in ruins, and scattered here
and there along the right bank of the river.
I was one day obliged by the rain to seek a
shelter in one of these habitations; I chose
the most promising, but in entering it I was
nearly overcome by the noxious air, and
words are too weak to describe the shocking
picture of misery that struck my eyes. So
far from finding a shelter in this house, I
was in the course of a quarter of an hour
almost deluged; the rain poured down like
a torrent from every opening in the roof,
and I preferred the braving it in my boat.</p>

<p>Fishing and hunting fill up the leisure
hours of these out-laws; their vicious propensities
are still the same, and they are influenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
by no other motive than interest
or fear. Upon the approach of a boat, they
always attempt by flight to escape from the
painful service imposed on them by government.
They played me this trick more
than once. When I arrived at a station,
of five or six men who ought to be constantly
ready to receive the commands of
travellers, one only appeared; the rest had
hid themselves in the woods, and my preceding
guides were obliged to conduct me
to the next station<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. I recompensed these
unfortunate creatures the more readily, as
upon dismissing them I frequently saw their
feet covered with blood.</p>

<p>They over-reached me one morning in
a singular manner. A post boat going
down the river, passed near ours; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Golikoff’s turn to watch. The cunning rascals
asked his leave to change with their comrades,
and they knew so well how to persuade
him it was for our advantage, that
he consented. Eager to inform me of our
good fortune, he awaked me, but it was
merely to make me a witness with what
speed our villains sailed away, instead of
joining the boat that drifted by us. The
confusion of Golikoff at the sight may well
be conceived; he knew not what excuse to
make me, as we were obliged to draw the
boat ourselves to the next station; fortunately
however it was at no great distance.
The men who had conducted the post boat
were still there, and my two soldiers quickly
engaged them in our service. Their ready
compliance was I believe chiefly owing to
the brutal tone of Golikoff; our adventure
had put him so much out of humour, that
he could no longer be prevailed upon to
use moderation. “You do not know,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
he to me, “how to treat these rascals. If
I were to imitate your example, we should
be insulted at every poll, or be reduced
to difficulties similar to what we have just
experienced.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile we arrived 14 July at Olekma<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
without meeting with any other inconvenience.
This town, the first I had seen since
my departure from Yakoutsk, is seven or
eight hundred wersts from it, though in the
post expences it is only estimated at six
hundred. It is situated at the mouth of a
river of the same name, and is small, badly
built, and offers nothing worth notice. I
stayed there but two hours.</p>

<p>A few wersts on a small canoe came up
to us, with only one man in it. He offered
some bark of the birch tree, which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
stripped in the neighbouring woods; my
soldiers were eager to purchase it in order
to cover our boat. My trader was a Toungouse,
and belonged to a family that was
settled on the left bank<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. I did not lose
so good an opportunity of being better acquainted
with these people; I ordered
therefore my boat to be fastened on the
right bank, and accompanied only by Golikoff,
I entered the canoe of the Toungouse,
who was as highly pleased as myself with
the visit I was going to make to his relations.</p>

<p>I was struck with the form and lightness
of their canoes, the bottoms of which are
however so nearly circular as to present but
little surface to the water, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
they are easily overset. They consist of
laths disposed in net-work, and covered
with the bark of the birch tree sewn together
and fortified with tar. The ends are
narrow and pointed, and the oar is kept
in equipoise in the middle of the vessel, so as
to enable the rower to strike alternately
with either end.</p>

<p>The Toungouses expressed the utmost
joy at seeing me: surrounded, welcomed,
caressed, I was at a loss how to answer
their professions of friendship. A young
deer was killed and laid at my feet; in
making me this present, these good people
regretted that their poverty deprived them
of the ability and pleasure of being more
useful to me. I was not able myself to be
very bountiful in my presents, and I only
showed my gratitude by leaving them some
of my cloaths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>They are unsettled, like the wandering
Koriacs, and live nearly in the same manner.
Their yourts are not so large, and
are covered with the bark of the birch
tree; there is no other difference. Every
family has a distinct yourt; the chief ornamental
piece of furniture is a small wooden
idol of the human shape, but with an enormous
head; it is dressed in their cloaths,
and decorated with rings, bells, and other
pieces of metal. They give to this image
the name of Saint Nicholas, in allusion to the
patron saint of Russia.</p>

<p>I have already described the dress of
the Toungouses, and have therefore only
to speak of their features, manners, and mode
of travelling.</p>

<p>They are not so large as the Yakouts,
and have the sunk eyes, flat nose, and broad
face of the Kamtschadales. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
equally hospitable; their characteristic
qualities seem to be frankness and good-nature.
In religion, they have the stupid
credulity of the Koriacs, believing in all
the absurdities of idolatry. The chamans
equally obtain their homage and confidence:
these impostors govern every where
by means of the fears they inspire.</p>

<p>After fishing<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and hunting, which in
the season, oblige these families to be a little
more settled, nothing engages their attention
so much as their rein deer. These
animals constitute all their wealth, and repay
with usury the care bestowed upon
them. They not only provide these people
with food<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and clothing, but docile to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
the hand that guides them, they permit
their masters, both men and women, to
mount their backs, and ride them at a swift
pace wherever they please<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. Instead of
harnessing them to a sledge, like the Tchouktchis
and the Koriacs, they train them up
to carry in this manner, and make them
obedient to the motions of a bridle twisted
about their horns. The saddle is ornamented,
and of the same size as ours, but
without stirrups; it is fastened by a very
weak girt, and the rider, when he totters,
has nothing to support him but a long stick
with which he strikes his steed: it is manifest
that this exercise requires great skill. The
baggage is put into small panniers, covered
with rein deer-skin, and fixed to the saddle,
which hang on each side against the flank
of the animal. During the stay of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
Toungouses in any place, the burdens are
ranged methodically round their yourts.</p>

<p>My navigation became less disagreeable
when I had reached Pelodoui, a large village,
the inhabitants of which are Russians, descended
from the first cultivators of Siberia,
called <i>Starogili</i>. There I was freed from
the dangerous exiles, and had no other
guides than honest peasants, who were
equally assiduous and complaisant. The
houses were not so distant from one another,
and promised me at least some resource. In
each of these villages there are six men appointed
to conduct the business of the post:
no privilege exempts them from this service;
like all the Russian peasants they are annexed
to the glebe, pay the same duties to the
crown, and furnish recruits. The produce
of their harvests are not adequate to their
maintenance during the whole year; they
are obliged to purchase and lay up a stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
of corn. Rye is no where so dear as in this
place; it sells at seventy or eighty kopecs
the <i>poud</i>.</p>

<p>Vitim is the village nearest to the preceding
one. As it resembles all the Russian
villages, I need not describe it; churches
are less common than the <i>cabacs</i> or public-houses.</p>

<p>Birds are fond of the environs and the
borders of the Lena, where they very much
abound. The clouds of gnats which cover
it, account for this. To keep off these insects,
we had taken care to furnish ourselves
with a quantity of horse-dung, with
which we keep up a continual fire in our
boat; but another unavoidable inconvenience
on this river is the vermin it engenders;
the more we bathe, the faster they
multiply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>Four hundred wersts from Peledoui I
passed by a small town called Kirinsk, or
Kiringui, at the bottom of which the Lena
flows, and farther on the Kiringa. In the
midst of the houses, none of which make
any figure, we could distinguish the church,
which is built of stone.</p>

<p>The bank becoming wider and more
sandy, we were frequently drawn by horses<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.
The ropes were weak, but it gave me no
uneasiness; the pleasure of advancing inspired
me with a blind confidence, for
which I was soon punished. In the night
of the 29, my boat touched upon a rock,
which the darkness concealed from us. The
rope broke with the violence of the shock, and
our boat was in a minute full of water; we
had only time to get out, in order to draw it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
upon the shore, which required all our efforts.
I immediately mounted one of the
horses, with my box before me. We were
but four wersts from a village, and it was
easy to have speedy succour. My boat was
refitted in the course of the day, and the
next morning I proceeded on my route.</p>

<p>In quitting the village of Ustiug, I perceived
a considerable salt pit that was pointed
out to me, and beyond it three <i>zavodes</i> or
copper founderies.</p>

<p>My boat was broken a second time, and
again hastily repaired; this day also, which
was 4 August, my rudder, which continually
struck against the bottom, was carried
away, as well as a kind of keel that was fastened
under the boat, and I abandoned it
without hesitation. It became the perquisite
of my faithful Golikoff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<p>I took horses at Toutoura, which is three
hundred and seventy wersts from Irkoutsk,
and having passed through the large village
of Verkhalensk, I arrived the 5, at two
o’clock in the afternoon, at that of Katschouga,
where it is common to land in order
to avoid the elbow of the Lena, and
also because this river soon ceases to be navigable.
In this village travellers are provided
with <i>kibitks</i><a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, or Russian four wheel
carriages, which are conducted by exiles,
and from time to time by the Bratskis.</p>

<p>Between Katschonga and Irkoutsk is a
<i>step</i> or uncultivated district, inhabited solely
by these Bratskis, a colony of shepherds,
supposed to be descended from the Tartars,
so strongly do they resemble that people.
There is something ferocious and savage in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
their appearance; they are extremely addicted
to robberies, and I saw one of them
apprehended for stealing some cattle. Their
flocks are numerous and consist of oxen,
cows, horses, but chiefly sheep. The speed
with which I travelled, prevented me from
visiting their habitations, or making more
minute observations respecting them.</p>

<p>We passed over a number of mountains,
through very horrible roads, and which
made my poor Golikoff frequently cry out,
bruised by the continual jolting of our infernal
vehicle; it was the first time he had
experienced this mode of travelling. At
length, having left the monastery of Voznessenskoï
at our right, whence Irkoutsk begins
to be visible, we came to a small arm
of the river that winds along under the
walls of the town, and which we crossed
without coming out of the carriage. There
I was stopped by a centinel, who was desirous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
agreeably to his office, of informing
the governor; but satisfied with my name
and office, which I gave him in writing, he
permitted me to go before him. It was
about eleven o’clock in the evening of 6
August, when I entered this capital, having
travelled, since I left Yakoutsk, fifteen hundred
and ninety-four wersts.</p>

<p>I alighted at the office of police, to enquire
for a lodging. The <i>kvarter-mester</i>,
or superintendant of that department, led
me to a house, the master of which, far
from obeying the orders injoined on him
to receive me, deigned not to rise from his
seat to declare his refusal. I saw the moment
when the officer of the police, irritated
at so uncivil a behaviour, was on the
point of avenging his insulted authority. I
succeeded however in pacifying him, and
besought him to chuse me another lodging.
In the interval the <i>gorodnitsch</i>, or commandant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
of the place, major Dolgopoloff, had heard of
my arrival, and the trifling mortification I
had experienced; he came immediately to
the place, which I had scarcely taken possession
of, made a thousand apologies for my
having been so indecently treated and so
badly accommodated, and in spite of all I
could say in favour of my apartment, he
obliged me to quit it, and to go with him.
I lost not by the change: nothing could be
more neat and elegant than the apartments
to which he conducted me. It was a suite
of rooms perfectly furnished and ornamented
with paintings in fresco; but what
pleased me most was the zealous attention
that was bestowed upon me, and by which
all my wishes were anticipated.</p>

<p>The next day M. Dolgopoloff presented
me to the governor, major general Arsénieff,
and I gave him the dispatches of M.
Kasloff, as the governor general was then at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Petersburg. I was highly flattered by the
manner in which M. Arsénieff received me.
After loading me with civilities, he insisted
that I should have no table but his, and
introduced me to his family<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>, whose harmony,
good sense, and cheerfulness, render
his house a truly delightful habitation, and
communicate their own character to the
society whom their merits attract.</p>

<p>I profited of the disposition and obliging
offers of the governor, to recommend
to him with warmth my soldier Golikoff.
The innumerable services which this brave
fellow had rendered me, his fidelity, his
devotedness and zeal, which had stood every
proof, pleaded more strongly in his favour
than my recommendation, and M. Arsénieff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
was desirous of securing to himself so
good a subject; but the ambition of poor
Golikoff<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> wished for nothing farther than
the being incorporated in the garrison of
Yakoutsk, where he was attracted by affection
to his father, who lived in that town,
and attachment to M. Kasloff, under whose
orders he considered it as a happiness to
serve. Such sentiments increased the interest
which my account of him had inspired,
and my protégé instantly obtained
the favour I solicited for him.</p>

<p>I afterwards made a visit to M. Poskatschinn,
the intimate friend of M. Kasloff,
whose recommendation procured me every
species of civility. I found at his house a
catholic priest, sent into Siberia to assist the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
Christians of the church of Rome, by his
ministry. His usual residence is at Irkoutsk.</p>

<p>This town, the capital of the government
of Irkoutsk and Kolivania, is situated on the
border of the Angara, and near the mouth
of the Irkout, from which it takes its name.
Within its vast circumference many stone
edifices are seen, and churches built with
bricks; the wooden houses are large and
commodiously distributed; its population
is numerous, and its society brilliant; the
multitude of officers and magistrates who
reside there, have introduced the modes and
customs of Petersburg. Every person in
office has an equipage; rank and quality
regulate the number of horses that draw
their carriages, which are similar to ours.</p>

<p>I have already observed, that all the tribunals
of the neighbouring provinces are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
under the jurisdiction of those of this
town; it is also the see of an archbishop, a
venerable prelate, who exercises the functions
of that office through the whole extent
of this part of the Russian empire.</p>

<p>But it is to commerce that this capital
is chiefly indebted for its splendour. By
its situation, it is the entrepôt of that which
is carried on between Russia and China. It
is known that an intercourse is kept up by
land; sometimes active, sometimes languishing;
frequently interrupted, it has undergone
so many variations, that it is necessary,
in my opinion, to go back to the origin of
this connection to judge of its consistence,
and the improvements of which it is
capable.</p>

<p>The first accounts are dated in the middle
of the last century, about the time of
the invasion of the Mantchew Tartars, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
having for a long time ravaged the northern
provinces of the Chinese empire, at last
subjugated it entirely. It was to a governor
of Tobolsk, that Russia was indebted
for the first idea of effecting this commerce,
in consequence of an attempt made
at Pekin by persons of confidence whom
he sent thither. Far from being discouraged
by the trifling success of these emissaries,
Russian and Siberian merchants united
together to profit, if it were possible, by
their discoveries. They sent out a caravan
in the year 1670, which brought back new
lights upon the subject, and unequivocal
proofs of the possibility of succeeding.
From that time companies multiplied,
the journeys became more frequent, and
establishments increased.</p>

<p>This progress alarmed the Chinese, who
resolved to set bounds to it. Forts were
erected to restrain a neighbour, who, advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
nearer every day, by the river
Amour, the Eastern Sea, and the Selinga,
insensibly approached the frontiers of China.
These defensive measures were the source
of very warm disputes between the two empires
upon the subject of their respective
boundaries; a few hostilities took place,
and at last an open rupture. Many years
were spent in besieging places, in demolishing
and erecting them in turns, till the year
1689, when the two courts, by the mediation
of father Gerbillon and father Pereira,
Jesuits, authorised by the emperor of China,
signed, at Nertschinsk, a treaty of peace
and perpetual alliance<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, which was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
engraven on two stones or posts erected on
the confines of each empire.</p>

<p>By this reciprocity, there was a free commerce
secured to all the subjects of the two
powers, who were furnished with passports
by their courts. Meanwhile China had
taken care to be paid for her condescension
by the surrenders she demanded of Russia,
who lost not only an important part of its
possessions, but the navigation of the river
Amour as far as the Eastern Sea.</p>

<p>To make amends, or with a view of deriving
greater advantages from this commerce,
Tzar<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Peter the Great commissioned, in
1692, Isbrand Ives, a Dutchman, in his service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
to ask of the court of Pekin, the
same privilege for caravans, which the late
treaty granted to individuals. The result
of the embassy corresponded with the desires
of the court of Petersburg; the caravans
were admitted; and as the court reserved
to itself the exclusive right of sending
them, it received the whole of the profit<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.
These journeys lasted three years;
caravanseries, for the exchange of their
commodities, were appointed for the Russian
merchants who composed the caravans,
and during their stay at Pekin their expences
were discharged by the emperor.</p>

<p>This calm did not long continue between
the two powers. New troubles, occasioned
by the misconduct, drunkenness, and insolent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
proceedings of some Russians, in the
midst even of the Chinese capital, had nearly
annihilated their commerce. The embassy
of Ismaïloff saved it. By the skill of this
negociator, captain of the guards to the
Tzar, the disorders were stopped, and the
complaints suppressed; security and confidence
succeeded to this misunderstanding.
To preserve this happy disposition, Laurent
Lange remained at Pekin, under the denomination
of agent to the Russian caravans.</p>

<p>Upon, the departure of this resident, affairs
continually declined and the enormities
of the Russians increased. They excited
the pride and distrust, natural to the
Chinese. The refusal to deliver up a number
of hordes of Mongouls, who were become
tributary to the Tzar, completed the
indignation of the emperor; every Russian
was banished from his territories, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
there was no longer any communication
between the two nations.</p>

<p>In 1727, count Ragouzinskoi, ambassador
from Russia to the successor of the vindictive
Kam-hi, effected the renewal of these
commercial ties by a new treaty, that fixed
irrevocably the bounds of each empire<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>,
and subjected the merchants to an invariable
regulation, calculated for ever to remove
all source of division.</p>

<p>The court of Russia was permitted to
send a caravan to Pekin once in three years,
and the number of merchants was limited
to two hundred. On their arrival at the
frontiers of China, they were to inform the
emperor, that a Chinese officer might be
sent to escort them to the metropolis, where
their expences would be defrayed during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
the time of their traffic. It was agreed
also that the merchandize belonging to individuals
should not pass the frontier, and
that they should no longer enjoy the privilege
of trading in any of the Chinese or
Mongoul territories. Of consequence, two
places were assigned them on the confines
of Siberia, the one called <i>Kiakhta</i>, from a
stream that waters the environs, the other
<i>Zurukhaire</i><a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>, situated on the left bank of the
Argoun, and they were obliged to deposit
their merchandize in the magazines of these
two settlements.</p>

<p>In spite of the solemn ratification of all
the clauses of this compact, its execution
encountered various impediments; the leaven
of resentment fermented, or dishonesty
gave birth to fresh knaveries. Be this as
it may, in the space of twenty seven years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
only six caravans sat out from Russia; and
after the last envoy this commerce fell into
a state of languor consequent upon the loss
of credit.</p>

<p>I suppress the detail of grievances alledged
by the Chinese against the Russians.
Many well known historians have given an
account of the complaints that occasioned
the successive emigrations of the Kalmouk
Tartars, and a multitude of Toungouses,
who were all received by the court of
Petersburg; we have seen its subtle policy,
moderate and threatening in turns, always
evading the satisfaction demanded by
China.</p>

<p>These disputes continued till the accession
of the reigning empress. No sooner
had Catherine II. ascended the throne, than
she renounced, in favour of her subjects, the
monopoly of furs, and the exclusive right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
of sending caravans to Pekin. This act of
justice and beneficence, worthy the genius
and heart of this empress, was still insufficient
to give to this commerce its antient
vigour. The enmity between the two nations
was farther heightened by the fickleness
of these Toungouses, who, tired or discontented
with their new establishment, suddenly
eloped from the dominion of Russia,
and returned to their country to replace
themselves under the Chinese authority.</p>

<p>It has since been seen that the two nations,
discarding all animosity, entered into
a sincere connection, and that the intercourse
between the merchants became every
day more active and interesting. As the
Russian factories multiplied at Kiakhta,
which is peopled, enlarged, and fortified,
the Chinese resorted to the settlement of
Zurukhaire or Naïmatschinn; the commissaries
on each side presided in the exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
of commodities, and the Mongoul language
was adopted in the contracts which were
made by interpreters.</p>

<p>The Russians have not the advantage in
this commerce. The Chinese, who trade
in a body, are infinitely more watchful over
their interests and circumspect in their dealings;
they know how to discover the real
value of the Russian commodities, and they
have the skill to sell their own at the price
they first fix, and from which they never
depart. Tea, for instance, procures them an
immense profit<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>; they sell it so dear that
the purchasers are afterwards obliged to
get rid of it with loss. To indemnify
themselves the Russians endeavour to raise
the price of their skins, of which the Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
are extremely fond; but the cunning
of these people puts them on their guard
against this trick.</p>

<p>It would be too tedious to enumerate in
this place all the articles that enter into
these exchanges. I refer the curious reader
to Coxe or Pallas, who are both diffuse on
the subject. By a calculation which they
made of exports and imports at Kiakhta, in
the year 1777, the amount of this commerce
was estimated at four millions of
roubles; but since that time, various accounts
deserving of credit assert that it has
considerably lessened, and at present it may
be said to be reduced to nothing<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>
<p>I had no preparation to make for my
departure, but that of purchasing a kibitk<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
I no longer troubled myself about
provisions, as I was sure of finding wherewith
to subsist myself at every stage. The governor
gave me a <i>poradojenei</i>, or a passport, as far as
Petersburg. It was resolved that I should
be escorted by a soldier of the garrison,
whose courage and fidelity were known,
and that one of the couriers of the governor
general, who had particularly recommended
him, should accompany me to assist
me by his services and experience.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>
<p>I took leave of M. Arsénieff; his son and
M. Dolgopoloff insisted upon conducting me
to the first stage, in spite of all my remonstrances.
We were seated in the carriage,
where my honest Golikoff came with tears in
his eyes, conjuring me to permit him to accompany
me as far as these gentlemen; it
was, he said, the sweetest recompence I could
bestow on him. This last instance of attachment
affected me, and I felt that in
complying with his request, my pleasure
was not less than his.</p>

<p>Having crossed in a ferry boat the river
Angava<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>, we soon arrived to the place of
our separation. While I repeated my thanks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
and took leave of my two friends, Golikoff,
concealed behind my carriage, endeavoured
to hide his tears, and recommended me to
the care of the soldier who succeeded him.
His despair burst forth when my horses
were harnessed; he embraced my knees,
and exclaimed that he would never quit me.
It was to no purpose I repeated that, as he
well knew, I had no right to take him; my
reasonings, my caresses, nothing could prevail
on him to leave his hold; it was necessary
to force him from my feet, then from
the carriage, which he seized on being torn
from me. Never, I believe, had my sensibility
experienced a more violent shock; I
departed with a wounded heart. The regret
of not having been able to follow the dictates
of my gratitude<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> still torments me,
and I can only hope that he may be informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
of it, for I cannot flatter myself that
I shall ever see him again.</p>

<p>I am obliged at present to discontinue my
practice of making notes every day. My
journey to Petersburg was so rapid, that is,
from 10 August to 22 September, that it
was impossible to observe the same accuracy;
for this reason also the reader will
pardon the brevity of my observations.
The country through which I passed has
beside been described by so many accurate
and intelligent pens, and these travellers
have given so much attraction and interest
to their recitals, that I should only be accused
of presumption, or plagiarism, if I attempted
to enlarge on a subject, which they
profoundly studied, while I had scarcely time
to skim the surface. Many of these performances<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
are recent, and the curiosity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
the reader may be amply satisfied by them.
I shall only speak of what relates to myself.</p>

<p>I first passed through a small canton inhabited
by Bratskis. Are not these the same
people described by other French writers,
under the appellation of <i>Burates</i>? Beyond
Oudinsk I came to Kransnoyark, where I
stopped twenty-four hours to repair the
axle-trees of my carriage. This town derives
its name from the red and steep bank
of the Yenisei, which runs under its wall.</p>

<p>I afterwards entered the desert, called
<i>Barabinskoi-step</i>. The post service is performed
by exiles of every description, whose
settlements are at the distance of twenty-five,
and sometimes fifty wersts from one
another. These unfortunate beings live in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
the same manner as those who conducted
me from Yakoutsk to Peledoui; they are
neither more serviceable nor less ferocious,
and their indolence is still more mortifying.</p>

<p>Accustomed to the fertile and rich country
about Irkoutsk, cultivated by the laborious
Starogili, the eye cannot survey, without
pain, this barren waste. We are disposed
to ascribe this melancholy contrast to
the sloth of the perverse inhabitants, though
it is acknowledged that the soil yields them
no return. One might say, that in conformity
with the vindictive hand that pursues
them, Nature acts towards them as a
step-mother; the earth, to which justice has
banished them, seems to feel a reluctance in
bearing them; its withered bosom refuses
all success to their culture.</p>

<p>My courier, who had the rank of serjeant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
did not treat these miserable creatures with
more attention than was expedient. To
enforce obedience, he frequently made use
of his stick, and my remonstrances could
not restrain him from these sallies, which he
called, in pleasantry, his reigning sin. One
day he had near paid for his cruelty in a
terrible manner. Arriving at a stage we
found no horses; the man upon whom the
business this day devolved, had been guilty
of the daring crime to absent himself, in
order to get hay. Two hours passed away,
and no one appeared; my courier at length
resolved to go himself, with my soldier, and
seize the first horses they could find. In
about half an hour they returned, in a very
angry humour, with a single horse, for
which they had been obliged to fight.
While they were relating the transaction,
the man whom they accused of being the
aggressor, ran to complain to me of their
having plucked off half his beard. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
same moment I was surrounded by more
than fifty persons, assembled from I know
not where, for as we entered the village,
we could perceive no one but the <i>starost</i>.
They seemed to contend who should reproach
him most; I spoke a long time
without being heard. My courier, instead
of assisting me in pacifying them, ran to the
postillion, who returned from the fields, and
made his arm pay dearly for the delay he
had occasioned us. The man, whose beard
had been torn off, prepared to avenge his
comrade, but the soldier, by order of the
courier, prevented him, and I was obliged
to deliver him from his hands. By dint of
vociferation and entreaties I at last suspended
the fury of the combatants. I
had great reason to applaud myself for my
moderation; the spectators were enraged at
the treatment their neighbour received;
they would infallibly have murdered us, if
I had not immediately ordered my two indiscreet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
attendants to return to the carriage,
and the postillion to make haste and
harness the horses. The crowd was desirous
of pursuing them, but at last I succeeded
in appeasing it, and they escaped
with a few invectives. I hastened to my
kibitk, and did not think myself safe till I
was out of their reach.</p>

<p>I trembled lest this event should circulate;
in the mean time, till my arrival at
Tomsk, a town at the end of this desert, I
saw not the least appearance of commotion.
My people were eager to carry their complaints
before the inspector general, and to
my great mortification they appealed to me
as a witness. This officer explained to me
the dangerous influence the affair would
produce upon the maintenance of order and
subordination, if these exiles of Baraba were
not severely punished; he accordingly prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
to set out for the spot, to make an example
of them.</p>

<p>My visit to the governor of Tomsk soon
consoled me for this disagreeable adventure.
I found him to be a Frenchman, of the name
of <i>Villeneuve</i>: his rank was that of colonel;
I was received by him as a countryman,
and I need say no more to express our mutual
joy at meeting. I conceived myself to
be already in France.</p>

<p>The town of Tomsk is tolerably neat; it
is partly upon an eminence, where the house
of the governor predominates, and the other
part descends to the river Tom. I only
staid while my wheels were repairing.</p>

<p>I met many companies of exiles, or galley
slaves<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>, and I was advised to be on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
guard against them. As individuals frequently
escape, the peasants are obliged to
pursue them as much from duty as for their
own safety. Nothing is in reality more
easy than for these exiles to make their
escape on the road; they are well guarded,
it is true, but they are never fettered. I
have seen in woods as many as eighty
destined to the same place; they were divided
into companies of four, five, or six
men and women, who followed at the distance
sometimes of two or three wersts.
They are afterwards distributed in the different
mines of Siberia: these were going
to Nertschinsk.</p>

<p>I crossed the principal rivers of this province,
as the Oka, the Yenisei, the Tom, the
Obi, which the Russians call the <i>Ob</i>. On
the last I ran a considerable risk in a small
ferry, which was in so wretched a condition,
that in the middle of the river it filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
water. We should have found some difficulty
in saving ourselves, but for a smaller
boat, that I had had the precaution to fasten
to the ferry, and others that were quickly
brought to our succour by the inhabitants
on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Before I arrived at Tobolsk, I passed the
Irtisch twice, the last time near the mouth
of the Tobol. This capital, situated between
these two rivers, would have been
one of the most beautiful towns of Siberia,
but a fire has made such havock as to reduce
the greater part of it to ashes. Prior
to this event, it was in two divisions, the
upper town and the lower town; the one,
built upon the platform of a mountain,
presented many beautiful edifices of stone;
the other was made up of wooden houses,
which were the first devoured by the flames.
By degrees the fire reached the upper part
of the town and the stone houses, where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
left nothing but the walls. I made no stay
at this melancholy scene; the impression it
made upon me was equally deep and forcible,
and I shall never forget the air of consternation
that was visible in the inhabitants,
who, from the highest to the lowest, laboured
indefatigably, but in mournful silence, to
repair their losses. Already the ravages
begin to disappear, and the foundations of
some houses and shops, all rebuilding of
stone, arise above the surface: it is probable
that the rest of the town will have the same
solidity.</p>

<p>In quitting it I passed the Irtisch a third
time to reach Catherinebourg, or Yekaterinbourg,
where I stayed twenty-four hours,
that my carriage might again be repaired.
I employed the time in visiting a gold mine
in the neighbourhood, and the place where
the copper money is coined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>I refer the reader to the authors I have
already cited, for a description of the colonies
of Tcheremisses, Tschouvaschis, Votiaguis,
and Tartars. I shall only say of these
last, that the neatness of the inside of their
houses astonished me, doubtless because I
had been a little too much accustomed to
the contrary defect among the Kamtschadales,
Koriacs, &amp;c. These Tartars lead
sedentary lives; they are husbandmen, and
have considerable quantities of corn and
cattle: the religion they profess is the Mahometan.</p>

<p>The head dress of the Tcheremisses struck
me with its singularity; it is a small shell of
wood, eight or ten inches long, and four or
five broad, placed near the root of the hair
upon the forehead, and the upper part with
an inclination forward. This is fastened
with a knot, and then covered with an
handkerchief, white embroidered or figured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
and, out of preference, they chuse the most
glaring colours and the most crowded patterns.
The handkerchief, which is very
large, and hangs loosely behind, is edged
with a broad fringe, or lace of gold or
silver, in proportion to the wealth or luxury
of the wearer. The rest of their dress cannot
better be compared than to a robe de
chambre.</p>

<p>I met a caravan of Bohemians who asked me
for money, and informed me that they were
going to people and cultivate a small canton
on the borders of the Wolga, near Saratoff.</p>

<p>The necessity of having my passport examined
by the governor of Casan, and the
difficulty of procuring horses, as I arrived
late, kept me in this town till break of day.
The Wolga, which washes its walls, renders
the situation pleasant; the houses are
for the most part built of wood, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
churches of stone. I was told that it is the
see of an archbishop.</p>

<p>Beyond the Wolga<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, a river famous for
its navigation, and which pours itself into
the Caspian sea, I passed before the towns of
Rouzmodemiansk and Makarieff. The latter,
celebrated for its linen manufactures,
is, property speaking, but a village. I was
at a small distance from it, and had just
crossed a bridge, ill constructed, and that
trembled under my carriage, when my impatience
was near costing me my life. My
postilion, animated by my repeated exhortations,
drove me with great rapidity<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>: on a
sudden I heard something strike hard against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
the box of my kibitk; I thrust out my head,
and received a blow that made me instantly
fall back in my carriage. A cry, uttered
by the courier who rode with me, informed
me that I was wounded. In reality a stream
of blood ran down my forehead: the carriage
stopped, I alighted; it was the circle
of my wheel that was broken, the edge of
which had struck me with the greater violence,
in consequence of our speed. On
putting my hand to the wound, it appeared
large and deep: I conceived that the skull
was injured, and I considered myself as a
dead man.</p>

<p>It is here I can say with truth, that language
is too weak to describe the excess of
my despair. After surmounting so many
obstacles, so many perils; at the very gates
of Petersburg, where I ardently longed to
embrace, in my arms, the best of fathers,
whom I had not seen for four years; on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
eve of entering my native country, of acquitting
myself of my embassy, by delivering
my important dispatches, and to be
struck by a mortal blow! The reflection
overcame me; I felt my knees tremble and
my head turn round; the succours of my
companions fortunately brought me to life:
I armed myself with courage, tied a bandage
tight about my head, the wheel was
adjusted in the best manner it could, and we
soon gained the preceding stage to Nijenei-novogorod.</p>

<p>I left my kibitk in this village to the care
of my soldier, with orders to have it repaired,
and to follow me immediately to the
next town. While my post carriage was
harnessing, and my box put into it, I entered
a public house, and had some very
strong brandy poured into my wound, and
a good compress placed on it, which enabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
me to proceed to Nijenei-novogorod, which
was from twenty-five to thirty wersts.</p>

<p>The surgeon major, at whose house I
stopped, was not at home, and in order to
wait for him, I was conducted into a most
filthy habitation. The desire of not being
known, and the uncertainty I was in respecting
my wound, induced me not to announce
myself to the governor. In the
afternoon I returned to the surgeon’s, but
to no purpose. Impatient of suffering, without
knowing what might be the effect of
my wound, I asked if there was no one
else who could assist me, and they mentioned
a <i>podleker</i>, or surgeon’s mate, who, after
many difficulties on his part, came to me.
His address gave me no favourable impression
respecting his talents and sobriety; it
had all the bluntness and tottering gait of a
drunken man. In the mean time the necessity
of having my wound probed, overcame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
the repugnance I felt of trusting myself
to such hands; but the wretch had forgotten
his instruments. Who would suppose
that a pin was the probe he borrowed?
Having examined it, he informed me, in a
fluttering manner, that my skull was laid
open, but not at all fractured, and that with
the application of brandy and water I might
continue my journey; he then advised me
to be blooded. The idea of trusting my
arm to such a drunkard made me shudder.
Having thanked, paid, and dismissed him, I
got into my carriage, happy to be rid both
of the operation and the operator.</p>

<p>Nijenei-novogorod is situated, as every
one knows, upon the Wolga, and is similar
to all the Russian towns. When I passed
through it, it boasted of the honour of
having a company of national comedians.</p>

<p>Leaving Vladimer, I came to Moscow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
M. de Boffe was anxious to have my wound
examined by the most skillful surgeons.
Their report gave me confidence, though
the pains in my head were tolerably acute.
I found myself the more consoled by the
removal of my fears, as I learned at the
same time a circumstance very much calculated
to increase them. M. de Boffe told
me that my father was not at Petersburg:
if therefore I had been dangerously wounded,
and this town had been the termination
of my career, I should have been deprived
of the consolation of ending my life in the
arms of him to whom I owed it.</p>

<p>My carriage being in a shattered condition,
I left it at Moscow, and sat off in
one of the common post carriages; but they
were so small and so incommodious, as not
even to shelter me from the rain. I passed
by Tver, Vonischnei-volotschok, Novogorod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
and Sophia near Tsarskocelo<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, and I
entered Petersburg in the night of 22 September,
having travelled six thousand wersts
in forty days, eight of which were lost
in the unavoidable delays I had experienced.</p>

<p>Agreeably to the instruction of count
de la Perouse, I delivered my packets into
the hands of count de Segur, minister plenipotentiary
from the court of France to
the empress. I had the pleasure of seeing
him on his arrival in Russia, and I count it
among the happy events of my life that I
now found him at Petersburg, to console
me for the absence of my father. This
minister not only received me in the most
gracious manner, but interested himself in
my health with every mark of affection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
He offered one of his couriers to accompany
and take care of me during
the remainder of my journey. Meanwhile
as the skill of his surgeon had effected
my cure, I thanked the count for
his obliging offer, but was unwilling to
deprive him of a man who might be necessary
to him.</p>

<p>Charged with his dispatches, I left
Petersburg the 26, between eleven and
twelve at night. At Remer, as the weather
was foul, I was eight hours in engaging
watermen to take me across an arm
of the sea called <i>Courich-haff</i>. I slept at
Berlin, count d’Esterno, minister plenipotentiary
of the king to this court, being also
desirous of sending dispatches by me; I was
well requited for this trifling delay, by the
flattering things which it occasioned me
from this minister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>At length I saw my native country, and
17 October at three o’clock in the afternoon,
I arrived at Versailles. I alighted
at the house of count de la Luzerne, minister
and secretary of state for the marine
department. I had not the happiness of
being known to him, but the very kind reception
he gave me, instantly prepared my
heart for the gratitude, which on so many
accounts I owe him. To his favour, upon
which I set the highest value, I am indebted
for the honour of having been
presented, the same day, to his majesty,
who condescended to interrogate me respecting
various circumstances of my expedition;
expressed a desire to know the
particulars; and recompensed me the next
day by appointing me consul at Cronstadt;
a recompence so much the dearer,
as it reminded me of the eulogiums
that had been bestowed on the zeal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
all my family, in the civil and political
offices with which they had been entrusted.</p>

to inflame the enmity of the Tchoukchis against the
Russians, either by false reports, or by inciting them to
attack such parties of Russians whom they could not, or
dared not, attack themselves. These artful manœuvres
have been the cause of the many acts of cruelty with which
the Tchoukchis have been reproached, but which form no

introducing himself, reminded me of the expedients he had
employed the preceding year to detain a sailor, charged
by government with important dispatches. The sailor,
anxious to arrive at the place of his destination, was prepared
to leave Pareiné, when Youltitka pressed him to wait
till the next day. He showed no disposition to comply,
but was desirous of proceeding immediately. The dispute
became warm. The enraged Koriac fell upon him, and
would instantly have assassinated him, if he had not been
torn from his hands. He was bound, and kept in confinement
for three days. At length, after having suffered
every sort of ill treatment, Youltitka permitted him to go,
with the hope perhaps of putting an end to him more
easily in his way; but the prey escaped him.</p></div>

of a surprise on the part of the neighbouring Koriacs,

wandering Koriacs. I found them in general more frank
and obliging, and shall presently give a proof of it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> The wandering Koriacs were for a long time still
more untractable. The independence to which they were
accustomed, and the natural restlessness of their character,
little disposed them to submit to the yoke. The Russians,
beside, from a love of conquest, were perhaps not remarkable
for moderation, and endeavoured probably to make
themselves feared rather than loved. It is certain that they
experienced the regret of seeing whole hordes suddenly disperse
upon the least appearance of oppression, and fly, as in
concert, far from the settlements where they hoped, by the
attraction of commerce, to fix them. These frequent
flights took place till the arrival of major Gaguen. By
the mildness of his government, his repeated invitations,
and beneficial proposals, he has gradually brought back
these fugitive families. First one returned, then two, then
three; the force of example, and a kind of emulation
operated upon others, and when I was at Ingiga there
were no less than eleven yourts in the neighbourhood of
that town.
</p>
<p>
But the skilful policy of major Gaguen has still more
successfully effected the views of the Czarina, by taking
advantage of the necessary commercial intercourse, gradually
to establish between the Russians and the Koriacs of both
descriptions in the neighbourhood, a reciprocity of good
offices, a kind of agreement between individual and individual,
that reminds us of ancient hospitality, and that will
one day infallibly operate a revolution in the manners of
this people.
</p>
<p>
If a Koriac be obliged by his business to pass the night
in the town, he demands a lodging of his Russian friend,
and without farther ceremony takes possession. His host
considers it as his duty to receive him, to study his inclinations,
to anticipate his wants, and his wishes; and in short,
spares nothing in order to entertain him in the best manner
he can, that is, to make him completely drunk. Upon his
return home, he relates with pleasure the flattering reception
he has met with. He considers it as an obligation, a
sacred debt, of which he is anxious to acquit himself the
first opportunity that offers. This is a pleasing custom,
particularly to a Russian soldier, who is obliged to make
frequent journeys to the neighbouring villages. The gratitude
of the Koriac towards his friend, does not confine
itself to the affording him a lodging, regaling him, and
supplying him with provisions for his excursion; he protects
him, and becomes his defence against his countrymen.</p></div>

as household gods, the guardians of their rustic habitations.
These idols, coarsely carved and blackened with smoke,
are hung up in the most conspicuous part of their yourts.
They are dressed in the Koriac mode, and adorned with
bells, rings, and various other iron and copper trinkets.
The other inferior deities they consider as inhabiting mountains,
woods, and rivers, which reminds us of the nymphs
in the mythology of the ancient Greeks.</p></div>

mentioned the post charges. While I travelled with M.
Kasloff, they were defrayed by him, and I did not pay my
share, till I came to quit him. The reader is intitled to a
note upon the subject, which I shall here give him.
</p>
<p>
These charges are called in Russia <i>progonn</i>: a courier pays
two kopecks per werst for every horse, and other travellers
four kopecks. A kopeck is equal to a French <i>sou</i>, or an
English halfpenny. In Kamtschatka and Siberia the expence
is less by one half, and as dogs are almost invariably
made use of in the peninsula, they are charged at so much
per <i>podvod</i>, or team of five dogs. Three podvods, or fifteen
dogs, are considered as equal to one horse in Siberia,
for which a courier pays a kopeck per werst, and other travellers
two kopecks.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> These compliments do not, as with us, consist of mere
ceremony and cold civilities, accompanied with unmeaning
words. The assembly is no sooner seated, than brandy
is introduced. A domestic distributes three enormous
bumpers to every individual, one of which would be sufficient
in any other country to make a man give in. Here
it is merely a provokative to double and triple the dose. A
Koriac toper considers it in no other light, and when it is
presented to him, he gives a complacent smile to the whole
company, and particularly to the master of the house, to
whom also he makes a slight inclination of the head. He
then swallows, one upon another, without the least sign of
repugnance, three glasses filled as fast as possible. The
children drink it with as little aversion. I have seen a
child six or seven years old take off one of these glasses,
without making a wry face.
</p>
<p>
To this copious distribution of brandy M. Gaguen never
fails to add some presents of iron, stuffs, or tobacco, and
carries his attention so far as to consult the taste and wants
of each individual. The Tchouktchis, and the fixed Koriacs,
are treated with similar kindness. By this means he
has gradually tamed these savage minds, and gained an influence
and ascendency over them: a poor recompence for
the sacrifices he is obliged to make to provide these liberalities,
the expence of which falls solely upon himself, and
from the dearness of every article in this country, must be a
heavy burthen to him.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Sometimes the lower part of this rein is furnished with
little sharp pieces of bone, which, with the smallest shock,
serve to goad forward the animals that are untractable, and
are continually employed for that purpose. In harnessing
the rein deer, they are careful not to put on the right the
beast that is trained to draw on the left, the sledge would
otherwise, instead of advancing, be instantly overturned.
This trick, however, the Koriacs frequently play upon the
Russians, who they think have treated them ill.</p></div>

language as fluently as his own; he wanted only confidence
to express himself equally well in French. He had

rich in the public esteem, and happy in the opportunity
which his situation affords him of doing good.</p></div>

this season of the year, they ascend the loftiest trees, where

weakness of these poor animals, who have no other sustenance,
during the whole winter, than the branches of willows,
or birch trees. With such nourishment, what service
was to be expected from them! To support so long
a fast, they surely stand in need of the respite from labour
which is commonly allowed them during this season of the
year; and even at the commencement of spring, it is not
prudent to make use of them till they have recovered their
strength by better pasture. The fields are no sooner freed
from the snow, than they disperse in eager pursuit of every
little blade of grass, and devour the shoots almost before
they spring out of the ground; rapid as the vegetation is in
this country, it must be supposed that a considerable time
is necessary to recover their vigour.</p></div>

and nature of the commercial alliance between these two

more accurate information.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> I shall not enter into particulars respecting the manner
in which these settlements were made. The Russians unfortunately
displayed neither more integrity nor greater humanity
than in their preceding conquests; and I wish it
was in my power to draw a perpetual veil over the scenes
of horror which they repeated on their arrival in these climates.
But the many instances of injustice and dishonesty
practiced by the chiefs, pilots, merchants, and sailors, have
given rise to such a variety of complaints and suits, and so
many authors have written upon the subject, that my silence
could have no effect. It is well known that a number of
ships employed in this trade have been accused of taking by
force, instead of purchasing, the furs which they brought
back, and sold at an immense profit. Not content with tearing
from the unfortunate indigines these fruits of their courage
and labour, they sometimes compelled them, under
the immediate inspection, and for the sole profit of the crew,
to hunt otters, beavers, sea cows, foxes, and other animals;
and frequently from an excess of distrust or avarice, they
hunted themselves. Such conduct induces us to believe
that they were guilty of crimes still more shocking. It is
not to be supposed that at so great a distance, the injunctions
and menaces of the empress should in all cases so far operate
as to prevent enormities. Experience has too clearly
demonstrated, particularly in the extensive empire of Russia,
that authority becomes weak, in proportion as it is farther
removed from the center. How many years of vigilance
and discipline are necessary, before abuses can be suppressed,
and obedience effected! This has long been the object
of the existing administration, and there is reason to
presume that its exertions have not been fruitless.</p></div>

down from weakness or fatigue, they are abandoned to
their deplorable fate, and their carcasses are left to be devoured
by bears, who never relinquish their prey while any
thing remains but the bones. Every ten steps we see
skeletons of these horses, and from Okotsk to the cross of
Yudoma, I imagine that I passed more than two thousand.
My conductors informed me that the majority had
perished the preceding year, in conveying from Okotsk to
Yakoutsk the different materials required for M. Billings’s

themselves with difficulty. A part of their loads were still
under a kind of <i>labazis</i>, of which I have already spoken,

<p>
If I might be permitted to give my opinion, I would
venture to assert, that the dearest interests, both of Russia and
China, are concerned in the speedy accomplishment of this
new compact; but, that it may be cemented in a manner
more durable and beneficial to the respective commerce of
the two nations, it will perhaps be first necessary that they
should, in concert, lighten the burthen of taxes, and take
away all the restrictions that intimidate and discourage the
merchant. It might also be expedient for Russia, profiting
of the physical and natural advantages she possesses from her
situation, to fit out ships from Okotsk or Kamtschatka, or
some other port, which might go directly to Macao or
Canton, and carry on the trade at a much less expence than
by land. The communication between Okotsk and Siberia
is not very difficult, and this province would doubtless become
more flourishing when this route was more frequented.
These reflections naturally led me to what I
have said in the first volume of this work (<i>note, p. 9.</i>) of
the project of an English merchant at Macao. Why
should not the Russians make similar attempts? Have they
not better opportunities than the English of monopolizing
the fur trade with China? When the way was once opened,
it would be easy to extend the communication to new objects.
I say nothing of the inestimable advantage that
Russia would derive from this commercial navigation, in
having numerous and skilful seamen.</p></div>

merchant, who politely undertook to send them to Petersburg.
</p>
<p>
To settle this business, he invited me to sup with him.
While we were at table, the town experienced an earthquake,
which was tolerably violent, and lasted two minutes.
We perceived it by the shaking of our glasses, table,
and chairs; all the bells sounded, and many turrets were
thrown down. Upon the first terror it occasioned, various
conjectures were formed respecting the cause of this shock;
as I perceived that the motion, or undulation, was from
south to north, it was supposed to originate in a neighbouring
lake, called <i>Baikal</i>. I leave it to naturalists to decide
the question.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_110_110" id="Footnote_110_110"></a><a href="#FNanchor_110_110"><span class="label">[110]</span></a> This river, taking the name of <i>Tounkoutska</i>, runs as far
as Yenisei (near the town of Yeniseisk) and, at some distance
from Irkoutsk, falls into the vast lake, which the
Russians call the sea of <i>Baikal</i>. This lake is said to be
surrounded with lofty mountains, its water is fresh, but the
navigation of it is unsafe, on account of the frequent storms
to which it is exposed. I much regret the not having been
able to visit it.</p></div>

the triple merit of accuracy, energy, and extensive information.</p></div>

part are we driven so rapidly, and the reason is that they
are almost always tipsy. In the villages, after harvest, it
is necessary to take them by force from the public houses.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
